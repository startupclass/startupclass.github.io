WEBVTT

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.140
All right, good afternoon.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.303
Today&#39;s guest speaker is
Emmett Shear,

00:00:05.303 --> 00:00:06.796
Emmett is the CEO of Twitch.

00:00:06.796 --> 00:00:08.236
&gt;&gt; Hello.
&gt;&gt; Which was acquired by

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:09.892
Amazon, where he now works.

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:14.460
And Emmett is going to do a
new formal of class today, and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.320
talk about how to do great
user interviews?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.040
So this is the talking to
users part

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.490
of starting a startup, should
be really useful.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.880
Thank you very much for
coming.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks Tim.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.110
&gt;&gt; Contact server knows where
I&#39;m coming from, from this.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.940
We started our, I started my
first startup with Justin Kan

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.370
right out of college we,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.030
started this company called
Kiko Calendar It didn&#39;t go so

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.850
well, it, it went, all right.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.320
We, we, we built it we sold
it, but we sold it on Ebay so

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.000
that&#39;s not necessarily, the
end you want for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.090
your startup,
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.800
It was it was a good time.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.640
We learned a lot, we learned a
lot about programming.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.540
We didn&#39;t know anything about
calendars,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.730
neither of us were users of
calendars nor did we.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.420
During the period of time,
we&#39;re thinking you&#39;ve got to

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.150
talk to anyone who actually
did use a calendar.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.440
So that was, that was not
optimal.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.180
we, we got the build stuff
part of the, startup down,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.640
we did not get the talk to
users part.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.020
The second startup we started
we used, a very common trick,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.890
that lets you get away with
not talking to users,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950
which is that we were our own
consumer.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.390
We, we had this idea for a
television show, Justin TV,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.790
a reality show about Justin
Kan&#39;s life.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.970
And we built a whole set of
technology and

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.020
website around the reality
show we wanted to run.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.760
And so we were the user for
that for that product.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.320
And that&#39;s actually one way to
cheat and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.710
get away with not talking to
many other users is if you&#39;re

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.800
just building something that
literally is just for you.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.540
You don&#39;t need to talk to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.740
anyone else because you know
what is you want.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.810
And what you need.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.370
But that&#39;s if you&#39;re really
limiting,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.249
where to start a startup.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.070
Most startups are not just
built for

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.490
the person who is who is using
them.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.110
And when you do that, every
now and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.920
then, you get really lucky.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.800
And you are representative of
some huge class of

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.520
people who all want the exact
same thing you do.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.360
But very often also that just
turns into

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.780
a side project that doesn&#39;t go
any where.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.370
so, we kept working on
Justin.TV for a while and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.730
we actually achieved a good
deal of success,

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.650
because it turned out that
there were

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.940
people out there who wanted to
do the same thing we did.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.590
Which was broadcast ourselves
live on the Internet.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.660
But, the issue with Justin.TV,
the thing that,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.670
the thing that sort of, kept
us

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.250
from achieving greatness is we
hadn&#39;t figured out yet.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.460
How to how to build towards
anything beyond that

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.930
initial TV show.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.650
We knew how to, we built a
great product actually.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.450
If you wanted to run a live
24/7 reality TV show about

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.040
your life, we had the website
for you.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.110
We had exactly, what you
needed.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.640
But if we wanted to go do more
than that.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.690
If we wanted to open it up to
a broader number of people,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.680
a broader spectrum of people,
a broader use cases.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.520
We didn&#39;t have we didn&#39;t have
the insight to figure that out

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.740
because we weren&#39;t that user
and so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.530
at some point we decided to
pivot JustinTV.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.770
We decided we needed to go in
a new direction.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.420
We thought we&#39;d built a lot of
valuable technology but hadn&#39;t

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.120
identified the use case that
would let it get really big.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120
And there were two directions
that seemed promising.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.270
One of them was mobile.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.230
And one of them is gaming.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.210
And I led the gaming

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.030
initiative inside of the
company.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.070
And what we did with gaming
that was very very different,

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.410
from what we&#39;d ever done
before.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.550
Was, we actually went and
talked to users,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.850
because while I loved watching
gaming video, I was very aware

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.580
that neither I nor anyone else
in the company knew about

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.370
broadcasting video games.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.070
And so I would amp up the
content, I thought there was

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.950
a market there, that was sort
of the insight that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.690
I had which wasn&#39;t common at
the time,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.190
which was how much fun it was
to watch video games.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.350
Quick show of hands, people
know about watching video game

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.870
on the internet here?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.150
Okay, I&#39;m just going to assume
that people listening to

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.820
this also know about it.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.490
If you don&#39;t know about, if
you don&#39;t know about watching

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.970
video games on the internet,
you should go read about that.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.450
Because it&#39;s sort of,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.940
an important context for the
stuff I&#39;m going to talk about.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.330
But the main point is I
thought

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.340
that was awesome but I didn&#39;t
know anything about

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.210
the side of it that was really
important, which is

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.720
actually acquiring the content
to start broadcasting.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.390
So we went out, and we ran a.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.540
Actually a very large number
of user interviews.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.100
We talked to a lot of people
and brought that data back,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.290
and that formed the core of
all of the decision-making

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.190
that was for the next three
years of product features on

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.020
Twitch was sort of some of the
insights we got from that.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.640
And we continued to talk to
users, and

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.780
in fact built an entire.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.900
Part of the company whose job
it is basically to talk to

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.900
our users.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.640
Which is an, which is

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.540
a whole division that we just
didn&#39;t even have at JustinTV.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.970
We had no one at the company
whose job it

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.510
was to talk to our most
important users.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.360
So so that was Twitch.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.170
And I&#39;m, I want to give you
guys a little bit of

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.710
a a little bit of an insight
into.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.130
With Twitch.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.420
What, what that,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.330
what that meant, going to go
talk to users.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.310
So, we determined that

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.070
the broadcasters are the most
important people.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.830
And the reason we determined
that, was, when we went and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.780
looked into the market,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.470
we we looked into what, what
determined.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.330
Why people watched a certain
streamer or

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.660
went to a certain website.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.060
They would just follow the
content, right?

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.400
You had a, you had a piece of
content you loved and

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.890
the broadcaster would come
with you.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.950
And that&#39;s actually the one

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.780
really important point about
user interviews,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.270
which is that who you talk to
is as important.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.150
As what questions you ask and
you pull away from it.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.900
Because if you go and talk to
a set of users, if we&#39;d gone

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.640
and talked to viewers only, we
have, a complete different set

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.230
of feedback than talking to
the broadcasters.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.680
And talking to the
broadcasters gave us

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.310
insight into how to build a
link for them.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.750
That you&#39;re not to be
strategically correct.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.520
I wish I could tell the recipe
for

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.550
figuring out who the target
user is for your product and

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.630
who your target user should
be.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.170
But there isn&#39;t a recipe.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.620
It comes down to think really
hard and, and use your,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.710
use your judgement to figure
out,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.820
who you&#39;re really building
this for?

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.920
So what I want to do is a
little bit,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.334
something a little bit
interactive now, which is.

00:05:55.334 --> 00:05:57.810
sometging We&#39;re going to,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.700
I&#39;ve got a bunch of ideas
from, from you guys actually.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.460
So, sort of suggested ideas.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.540
And i&#39;m going to pick one of
them.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.580
And I want every one to sort
of sit down and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.250
do, do step one of this
process for me, right now.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.440
Which is think about who would
you go ask about this.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.320
Like which people.,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.120
Where would you go to find the
people you needed to talk

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.059
to about this.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.100
In order to in order to learn
about what you should build.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.110
And so the idea you&#39;re going
to use is, let me see here.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.340
Of these ideas, so

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.020
here it&#39;s a lecture focused
note taking app.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.760
The idea is I don&#39;t think that
the state of the art for

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.530
note taking is good enough
yet.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.800
And I want to make a note
taking app that improves.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.270
You know, improves that
experience.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.730
Makes taking notes in class
better.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.920
Or taking notes by listening
to a lecture online better.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.540
So you know, maybe it has
collaboration features.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.790
Maybe it, like, helps you
focus better somehow.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.390
It has multimedia
enhancements.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.290
I don&#39;t know, right?

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.700
All sorts of possible
features.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.770
But that&#39;s the, that&#39;s the
idea.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.950
So take, like,.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.360
Take 120 seconds right now,
and think about not what you

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.730
would ask, or what the right
features for

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.770
this app is, but who would you
talk to?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.740
Who should the, who,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.650
who&#39;s going to give you that
feedback that&#39;s going to tell

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.370
you whether this is good or
not?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.950
I actually mean it, right now.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.090
Take your laptop out, like
type, write some stuff down.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.680
Think, think about, like, the,
you can,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.260
it, it&#39;s good enough to.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.520
Like think of that in your
head.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.950
But actually, like if you
actually just write it down,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.650
and like just come up with the
five people you talk to,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.650
the five types of people you
talk to.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.100
And who you think the most
important one was.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.160
LIke, actually do it.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.000
Because there&#39;s nothing like
actually running

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.820
through a practice of
something and trying to do it

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.215
to actually get into your
head, the right way to do it.

00:07:35.215 --> 00:07:36.950
I&quot;m gratified to see here
clicking in,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.350
of the keyboards now.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.070
If you&#39;re following along at
home, pause, actually do it.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.818
Think about who you, who would
you talk to?

00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:54.618
Because that&#39;s a, that is the
first question

00:07:54.618 --> 00:08:00.237
for almost any startup that
you need

00:08:00.237 --> 00:08:05.853
to answer is like who is my
user and,

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:10.747
and where am I going to find
them?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.697
Alright that&#39;s like way
shorter than

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:26.216
you normally used to think
about this problem.

00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:28.764
It&#39;s actually a really tricky
problem in, like, figuring out

00:08:28.764 --> 00:08:30.900
where to source the people is
pretty hard, but ,.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.310
We&#39;re going to move along
anyways in the,

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.970
in this highly abbreviated
version of learning how to

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.130
build a product and run a user
interview.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.910
So can can I get one volunteer
from the audience to

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.550
come up and tell, tell us what
who you would talk to?

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.460
And we&#39;ll talk about it.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.364
You guys are all pre-selected.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.280
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here you go.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.150
I don&#39;t know, how to turn this
thing on, here we go.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.432
So who do you talk to?

00:09:00.432 --> 00:09:02.987
I would definitely talk to n
college students first,

00:09:02.987 --> 00:09:05.370
obviously because we sit in a
lot of lectures, and

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.097
specifically I want to talk to
college students studying

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:10.593
different subjects to see if
maybe, you know,

00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:12.012
if you&#39;re an English major,

00:09:12.012 --> 00:09:14.666
if that makes a different,
versus you&#39;re studying.

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:18.800
Of not, Computer Science in
terms of how you want to

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.920
take notes in lectures.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.600
&gt;&gt; And so you,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.670
you&#39;re going to talk to a
bunch of college students

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.280
Would you pick any particular
subset of college students?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.200
Like we&#39;re going to talk to
all college students or

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.300
like a broad array.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.410
&gt;&gt; I, I went out and talked to
college students.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.230
like, and break down the
divisions by like people who

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.500
study different areas maybe.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.580
And then also maybe it would
make sense for

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.520
people who have like different
study techniques.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.910
Because some people take a lot
of notes.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.210
Some people don&#39;t take that
many notes,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.600
but still jot stuff down.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.230
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.890
So I mean that&#39;, that&#39;s a
really good start.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.980
like that&#39;s, that is actually
obviously a group of users you

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.080
want to go talk to, especially
if you&#39;re targeting something

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.020
at, you know, at college
students as the consumer.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.190
And if you&#39;re talking to
college students,

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.790
as a consumer.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.000
the, you&#39;re going to get a lot
out of students,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.140
about, what their current note
taking habits are.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.070
And, you know, what they would
be excited about.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.330
One of the problems with
selling things to

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.890
college students, is that,
college students don&#39;t

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.460
actually spend very much
money.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.470
it&#39;s, it&#39;s really hard to get
you guys to open your wallets.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.960
Especially, if you want.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.510
Them to pay for a
school-related thing.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.217
And if you don&#39;t even want to
buy text books,

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:20.663
right, I think you probably,
probably all use or

00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:23.178
that you know, borrow it from
your friend or whatever.

00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:25.028
And so one of the like,

00:10:25.028 --> 00:10:28.730
one of the things that I think
you&#39;d be missing if you go

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.132
after just the students,
right, is you want to.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:33.028
Figure out who,

00:10:33.028 --> 00:10:36.236
who is the most important
person to this, to this app.

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.220
And if you&#39;re actually in a
note-taking app,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.353
my guess is for colleges, the
people most likely to

00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:42.783
actually buy a note-taking app
that you guys would used,

00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:44.570
would be College IT.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.550
Right, I mean, presumably for
most, for

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.630
the most part, if you want to
sell software to students,

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.520
like the people who have to
get

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.420
bought into that is usually
the school administrator.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.620
So that would be one, that
would be one approach,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.210
if you like thought that they
will.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.100
You presumably go talk to the
College students and

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.800
you find out they don&#39;t
actually,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.650
buy any note-taking software
right now at all.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.130
I mean, likely.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.940
It&#39;s possible they do in which
case I&#39;m,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.510
I&#39;m complete wrong and this is
where you actually have to go

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.190
talk to the users but

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.160
you then have to try to maybe
try other, other groups right.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160
So I would talk to college,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.460
I would talk to IT
administrators, as well.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.160
Think that&#39;s another.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.760
Area that&#39;s really promising.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.490
You might lo, talk to parents.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.520
Right?
Who, who,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.210
who spends money on their
kids&#39; Education and

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.730
is like willing to pull their
wallet out?

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.550
Like, the, you know, parents
of kids.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.130
Parents of kids, who are
freshmen who are going off to

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.540
college for the first time.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.310
You need this app to make your
kid productive so

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.880
that they don&#39;t fail out of
College.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.010
and, and as I see a lot of
groups that are potential,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:34.660
that aren&#39;t necessarily,

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.770
the obvious user, but who are
critical,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.780
critical to your app&#39;s
success, potentially.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.230
And when you, when you&#39;re at
the very beginning of

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.000
a startup like this, when
you&#39;re like,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.130
you have this idea that you
think is awesome.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.170
You want to have that broadest
group you possibly can.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.150
You don&#39;t just want to talk to
one type of person and,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.820
and, and learn that.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.260
You want to get familiar with
the space.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.200
You want to get familiar with
the various kinds of

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.420
people who be contributing.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.321
All right.

00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.382
So lets lets have somebody
come up and we&#39;re going to,

00:12:03.382 --> 00:12:07.240
we&#39;re going to pretend we&#39;re
going to the senior interview.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.390
So we&#39;re going to talk to a
college student and

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.290
try to find out what we should
build.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.280
You know, what we should get
into this note-taking app.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.761
So, so, some, another
volunteer please for, for

00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:18.807
running an interview.

00:12:22.044 --> 00:12:22.880
Yes.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.400
All right, so hello.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.850
&gt;&gt; Hi, I&#39;m Stephanie.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.980
&gt;&gt; Hi, Stephanie.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.920
&gt;&gt; Welcome, thank you for

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.298
agreeing to do this user
interview with us.

00:12:31.298 --> 00:12:34.853
So I, I wanted to, hear from
you about you know,

00:12:34.853 --> 00:12:37.310
what are your note-taking
habits.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.900
How do you take notes today?

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.500
&gt;&gt; Sure, so I take notes in a
variety of ways.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.870
I like to now because of speed
and efficiency and

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.330
just to come back to it later,
it&#39;s easier for

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.240
me to just take notes on my
lap top.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.630
And so a lot of those notes
will be primarily, text based.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.040
But in certain classes.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.650
So, for example,

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.080
if I&#39;m taking a History class,
most of it will be in text.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.140
But if I&#39;m taking it, taking a
Physics class for

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.880
example they&#39;re going to be
more complex diagrams,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.470
different angles that I have
to draw and

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.270
so that&#39;s little harder work,
harder for me to-

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.900
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s-
&gt;&gt; Get.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.020
&gt;&gt; What software do you use
for this stuff today?

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.320
&gt;&gt; I just do pen and paper for
that.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.630
&gt;&gt; You do pen and paper, so
you do a combination.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.996
You take notes with pen and
paper, you take notes-

00:13:11.996 --> 00:13:12.713
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; With your

00:13:12.713 --> 00:13:14.480
computer sometimes.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And when you take notes

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.340
with when you take all these
notes, again it&#39;s like,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.110
do you actually review them?

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.610
Like, do you, be honest, do
you actually go back and

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.910
actually ever look at these
notes?

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.790
&gt;&gt; The pen and paper not so
much.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:30.110
But yes to the software-based,
because it&#39;s more easy to

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.170
access and it&#39;s easier for me
to, to share and collaborate

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.140
and maybe even merge notes
with classmates and friends.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.330
&gt;&gt; So what do what do you

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.740
use to take notes today on
your computer?

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.040
Google Docs and Evernote.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.645
&gt;&gt; Google Docs and Evernote?

00:13:44.645 --> 00:13:45.145
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And ,.

00:13:45.145 --> 00:13:45.740
&gt;&gt; And.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.330
&gt;&gt; Tell me more about

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.720
like why two things at the
same time.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.430
&gt;&gt; So Evernote is easy, if I&#39;m
trying to just collect it for

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.920
myself, I think.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.150
And yes you can share, but I
think Google Docs for

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.720
me is easier to share and that
depends also if, you know,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.970
a friend has already created a
folder.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.010
For example on Google Docs and
I just have to add to that

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.790
folder if it&#39;s a group project
for example versus if it&#39;s for

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.530
my personal use I, I tend to
go more toward.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.280
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like you do

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.870
a lot of note-taking
collaboration.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:12.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What-

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.633
&gt;&gt; I wish it was integrated

00:14:13.633 --> 00:14:15.633
&gt;&gt; What tell me

00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:17.310
more about that.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.379
Like, like, do you take as,

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:22.060
do you want up taking most of
the notes, most of

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.140
the value of the notes out of
notes other people take?

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.790
Or is it mostly your own notes
you review at

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.400
the end of a semester?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.490
How does that work?

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.820
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s mostly, mine because
I&#39;m pretty picky about

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.970
the way I like things
organized.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.730
like, design wise, or
formatting.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.070
Even color, I&#39;m really
particular with.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.330
And, like, the font that we
use.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.050
And that really affects the
way I study.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.920
So, I tend to like, to like,
to like to personalize it,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.360
even after I merge.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.070
&gt;&gt; So, you, you pull in notes
from other people.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.830
But then you merge them into,
into the main.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.790
&gt;&gt; What works for me.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.290
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.570
awesome.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.300
And if you, if you have
Evernote notes and

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.085
you have Google Docs notes and
you have pen and paper notes.

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:04.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm,
&gt;&gt; Once the semester&#39;s over do

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.160
you ever go back to any of
that stuff or is it

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.070
like the quarter end, you guys
do have quarters here, right?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; One the quarter&#39;s over

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.980
do you ever go back to any of
that stuff?

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.480
Do you ever?

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.880
&gt;&gt; For classes not so much but
if it&#39;s notes I&#39;ve taken for

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.310
like talks like these, for
example, or

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.560
if it&#39;s like interview prep
that I&#39;m doing.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.320
I tend to go back because of
things that I like to kind of

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.120
keep fresh in my mind.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.780
And to help me prep for, for
future things.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.470
&gt;&gt; So that&#39;s interesting.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.190
Tell more about that.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.200
Like you take notes not just
in class?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I take notes to,
also to summarize main points.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.830
So if it&#39;s like inspirational
quotes.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.530
For example talks that I go to
like these.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.470
And then like, maybe I&#39;m going
to an event where I&#39;m

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.590
actually going to meet someone
and it,

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.450
it helps to actually to think
about and

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.040
to remember and recall what we
shared at the time that,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.290
you know, I attended the talk
or something.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:50.970
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.040
All right.
Well, normally I&#39;d

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.290
actually dig into a lot more
detail.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.510
There&#39;s a huge amount of like,
open questions that

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.750
are still in my mind after
hearing that stuff.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.140
Questions about, which people
do you collaborate with.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.470
Questions about whether or

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.370
not you like, like what the
volume of notes are.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.900
And like how, how long of, of
note-taking stuff.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.810
Just sort of, digging in to

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.610
like what the current behavior
is.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.722
But like in interest of time
and not like keeping everyone

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.658
here hearing about the
intricacies of one person&#39;s

00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.790
note-taking habits forever
we&#39;re going to move on.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.120
But thank you very much
Stephanie that was,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.300
appreciate that.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.270
So so that, that&#39;s like, that
kind of stuff,

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.960
you notice we&#39;re not talking
about the actual content of

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:27.800
the app at all.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.430
Like, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not,

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.340
I&#39;m not really interested in
features.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.117
I don&#39;t really want to know
about what they,

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:36.750
the specific feature set in
Google Docs and Evernote.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.030
I might start digging in a
little bit more into,

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.300
which features actually get
used.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.960
Like if she&#39;s actively
collaborating.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.230
You know is, how does that
work?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.550
I heard some interesting
things about oh,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.380
we, we use folders.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.550
That&#39;s interesting to me.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.660
But the main thing you&#39;re
trying to do when you&#39;re

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.610
running these first set of
interviews is not necessarily

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.860
get, like, questions about
like user flows and

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.590
like optimizing that, or
questions about

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.970
like the specifics of of, of
any of that stuff.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.880
kind of can be distracting
because users think they

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.630
know what they want.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.740
But like you, you get the you
get

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.850
the horseless carriage effect,
where you&#39;re, you&#39;re you&#39;re,

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.680
you&#39;re getting asked for a
faster horse instead of

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.630
trying to design the actual
real solution to the problem.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:19.940
If you start asking people
about features, so

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.300
you want to stay as far away
from features as

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.950
possible because the the
things they tell you.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.700
Wind up feeling, almost
overwhelmingly real.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.050
When you have a real user
asking you for

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.332
a feature, it&#39;s almost, it&#39;s
very hard to say no to them.

00:17:29.332 --> 00:17:32.440
Because here&#39;s a real person
who really has this problem,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.380
and they, they&#39;re saying build
me this feature.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.850
But as you start to talk to
lots of people and

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.880
really get a sense for what,
what their problems are, you

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.660
figure out if this is actually
a promising area or not.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.166
And like, based on what I
heard there, it&#39;s like.

00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:45.640
Starting from that interview,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.988
I&#39;m not necessarily positive
there is a problem or

00:17:47.988 --> 00:17:50.773
there&#39;s at least there&#39;s a,
there&#39;s a big enough problem

00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:53.515
that it&#39;s worth building a
whole new product for.

00:17:53.515 --> 00:17:59.820
Because I didn&#39;t hear a lot of
like things were were were.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.710
There was a, a big blocker, or
there was something really

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.840
wrong with the way it, the way
it was working.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.280
Unless I had some big idea I
would take that as,

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.412
you know, maybe a negative
sign.

00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:11.797
But it doesn&#39;t necessarily
mean that you can&#39;t,

00:18:11.797 --> 00:18:14.463
you can&#39;t move forward and
keep talking to more people.

00:18:14.463 --> 00:18:16.147
Because just because you talk
to the first person and

00:18:16.147 --> 00:18:17.256
you don&#39;t get anything out of
it,

00:18:17.256 --> 00:18:18.813
doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not going
to be.

00:18:18.813 --> 00:18:21.340
A ton more people, who
actually have a problem.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.500
And you, once you talk to
about six, seven,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.280
eight people you&#39;re usually
about done.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.890
It&#39;s unlikely you&#39;re going to
discover a bunch of

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.900
new information there.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.020
Which is why it&#39;s important to
talk to different extremes of

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.680
people right.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.550
Go, go find people who

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.850
are different different points
because this is just six or

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.610
seven Stanford college
students, you&#39;re going to get

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:41.850
a very different response when
we talk to six or

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.996
seven high school students, or
six or seven parents.

00:18:45.996 --> 00:18:53.508
All right, one second, let me
look at the So

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:59.100
based on that though, right, I
think the.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.990
I think it&#39;s possible you
could come up with,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.370
a set of ideas, right?

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.400
You have this information
about how someone takes notes,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.540
you&#39;ve, you&#39;ve come up with,

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.530
potentially when you came up
with this idea you had,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.330
you had some ideas as to, you
heard this idea, you had

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.140
some ideas as to like how you
could build something cool.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.510
And so, if you&#39;re going to
build

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.460
just one feature on top of
Google Docs.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.630
What would that feature be,
right?

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.550
And that&#39;s for, for, for a new
product like this, it might be

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.950
a good way to like get started
thinking about where to go.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.802
Which is,

00:19:29.802 --> 00:19:33.520
okay, they&#39;re extensively
using this things, right now.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.170
How can we make that

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.060
experience just one quantum
better?

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.530
Something that would be.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:42.040
Really exciting to this person
to be one one step ahead, and

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.420
so let me take two minutes,
right now.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.157
And think about, what that
feature might be?

00:19:47.157 --> 00:19:50.780
Actually like try to, try to
come up with what,

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.024
what you might do based on
what you heard from,

00:19:54.024 --> 00:19:56.817
from Stephanie, that could
convince her to

00:19:56.817 --> 00:20:00.895
switch away from her current
collaborative, multi-person,

00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:04.239
all-working-together workflow
on Google Docs?

00:20:04.239 --> 00:20:06.131
To your new, your new thing
that is,

00:20:06.131 --> 00:20:08.573
has all the features of Google
Docs plus this one

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:12.150
special thing that&#39;s, like,
going to make it,.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.433
It&#39;s going to make it more be,
more useful, and, and

00:20:14.433 --> 00:20:16.351
convincing the stop using that
they are using.

00:21:04.998 --> 00:21:05.965
Awesome, all right.

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:08.055
So, I&#39;m going to invite our,
our third guest, if you,

00:21:08.055 --> 00:21:09.650
if you have something up.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.480
I, I don&#39;t want to put you on
the spot if

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.709
you feel like you don&#39;t,
you&#39;re not sure, but.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So what I, what I, is

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:17.700
it on?

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.590
&gt;&gt; What I thought about was
like the, the reason she uses

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.770
Everknow is like, of like,
sticky note type notes like,

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.290
like more thoughts and like
details.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:31.320
So, I feel like, Google Docs
has like documents and

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.300
not like, smaller notes.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.740
So, I feel like a feature that
will be like,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.740
super like, a mobile version
of draw it

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.620
that doesn&#39;t like, isn&#39;t that
clunky and like, doesn&#39;t make

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.810
you make real documents could
be like, really useful.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.530
Awesome.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.640
So right.
That&#39;s a,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.460
that&#39;s a good insight.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.590
Right, that&#39;s exactly,

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.810
what&#39;s one of the thing that
you get out of that,

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:49.370
that user interview?

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.760
And then, you&#39;ve got this
idea.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.380
Right, you&#39;ve gotten this, I
guess, user-fed feedback.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.570
You&#39;ve got this idea.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.130
What if we&#39;ve had a Google
Docs that had

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.150
the collaborative aspects and
the group aspects of that, but

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.580
where you you could pull in
more little one off notes.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.320
And, it was, it was designed
more around note taking.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.270
And so, the question is, now,
once you have this idea,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.470
which I think it&#39;s the,

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.560
it&#39;s actually probably a
reasonable approach.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.790
Is this enough?

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.470
Is this something people would
actually switch just to have?

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.050
And, the way to validate,

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.010
there&#39;s two ways to validate
that.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.700
One is if you&#39;re quick at
programming,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.330
you can literally just go
build it, and

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.860
throw it out in the world and
see what happens.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.660
and, that&#39;s that&#39;s great.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.600
And, if that, when that works
that&#39;s

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.800
that&#39;s an excellent way to
approach it.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.990
But, a lot of the time that
one little thing that&#39;s just

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.050
a little bit better might take
you three months to

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.170
actually build something
worthy of actually using.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.060
And so, you actually want to
go out and

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.490
validate that idea further
before you go ahead and

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.720
start building it.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.950
And so, you might take that
idea, and

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.370
you might go back go back out
and

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.200
you know, you can sit down
with with diagrams.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.130
You can, you can draw what the
what it looks like.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.700
Draw the work flow, and go
bring that in front of people,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.540
but the one thing you really
don&#39;t want to do is

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.440
ask them this, this is sort of
a trap, and

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.880
I just want to warn you
against doing it.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.140
Just don&#39;t go out and say, to
come up with a feature idea,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.930
and go out and ask people.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.400
Are, you know?
I&#39;ve got this great idea

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:18.970
for a feature.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.570
Are you excited about it?

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.330
Because, the, the feedback you
get from users, if you tell

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.520
them about a feature, and ask
them, is this feature good?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.670
It&#39;s often, oh yeah, that&#39;s
great.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.000
Like, that sounds like such a
good idea.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.310
but, when you actually take
that in front of people, and

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.950
you actually build it.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.090
You then, find out that while
they thought it

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.740
was such a clever idea, no one
actually, like,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.200
cares to switch to get it.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.150
And so, the one question you
can&#39;t ask is this feature

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.650
actually good or not?

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.230
Yes, Sam?
&gt;&gt; What is

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.820
the minimum that you

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.350
could do in your experience to
actually if asking, you know,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.510
between asking and actually
building that whole thing.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So, Sam&#39;s asking if

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.670
what&#39;s the, what&#39;s the minimum
you can actually get away with

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.640
to validate, given that you
can&#39;t actually just go and

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.300
ask them is this good or not?

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.960
and, it&#39;s, it&#39;s highly
dependent the answer to

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.240
that is highly dependent on
the particular feature.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.590
But, usually the, the best
thing you can do is, is, is,

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.650
really just hack something
together, right?

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.220
It&#39;s, you find, if your, if
your idea is to build

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.120
something on top of Google
Docs, don&#39;t, for your V1,

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.670
go rebuild, an awesome Google
Documents, but

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.850
for note taking application.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.780
Find a way to write a browser
extension, that, that,

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.910
that stuffs just that little
bit of incremental feature in,

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.870
and, and see if it&#39;s actually
useful for people.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.610
go, like actually, go,

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.940
go find a way to cheat is what
it comes down to,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.740
because if you can&#39;t actually
put it in front of people

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.280
it&#39;s really, really hard to to
find that out.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.360
For bigger things, where
you&#39;re actually trying to,

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.670
get people to spend money, it
actually gets a lot easier.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.090
So, if you&#39;re selling it it&#39;s
great actually sales is

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.910
this cure all for this
problem.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:55.390
Get people to put, give you
their credit card and

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.650
I guarantee you they&#39;re
actually using the feature.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.780
It&#39;s it&#39;s one of the most
validating thing you

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.120
can do for a product, is go
out there and

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.780
actually get them to commit to
pay you up fron.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.350
And, the problem is when
you&#39;re working on

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.780
a student note taking app,
that&#39;s going to be

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.610
relatively hard because you
probably unless your idea is

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.120
that you&#39;re actually going to
sell it.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.100
It&#39;s probably something where
you&#39;re thinking at least the,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.840
if the trial version&#39;s free,
and you&#39;re not necessarily

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.810
going to learn that much by
trying to charge people money.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.220
But, if you go out there and

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.710
you can, if you can get people
to say hey I&#39;m going to,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.890
I&#39;m going to give you money?

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.860
The money test is amazing, it
really does clarify whether or

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.410
not, they&#39;re rereally excited,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.390
because if you&#39;re not
five-dollars-excited about it,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.690
you&#39;re probably not very
excited about it.

00:25:32.738 --> 00:25:36.083
so, the last thing I wanted to
do was actually work

00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:40.010
through with you guys, what
happened at Twitch.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.640
So I brought some slides of
feedback that I would like to

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.172
get put up.

00:25:43.172 --> 00:25:45.400
It&#39;s my, my only slides for

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.880
the for the thing and it&#39;s,
it&#39;s.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.980
What it is it&#39;s,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.530
it&#39;s, it&#39;s representative
excerpts of Twitch feedback.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.630
I had a whole like,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.260
26 page document full of all
the feedback.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.240
And then, I realized that

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.850
reading that was going to be a
little bit tedious and

00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:58.540
there was no way I&#39;d make it
through it in a lecture.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.409
So, pretend that like this is
stuff is all representative of

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.440
like, lots of people sent this
kind of thing out to,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.700
to ask for me ask them
questions.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.910
And, I&#39;ve already pre
condensed it for

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.310
you in to the real feedback
you got.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.570
So, when we were working on
Twitch to go launch it,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:18.300
we we wouldn&#39;t talk too

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.370
much about existing Justin.tv
Broadcasters and asked them.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.460
About their experience
broadcasting,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.130
what they liked about
broadcasting,

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.120
why they broadcasted, what
they broadcasted,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.020
what else was going on in
their life.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.710
And, the interesting thing is
when you talk to users of

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:31.570
your product who are,

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.590
who are detailed users of your
product, they come back to

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.190
you with actually very detail
things about features.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.820
Because they actually get
mired in the feature and

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.050
you have to sort of read
between the lines.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.960
But they asked for first
things like I want to be

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.810
able to, way to clear the
banlist in my chat room.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.100
Like, this, that was actually
a very

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.880
common request because there
was

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.730
a particular issue with how
our chat rooms worked.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.210
People had asked for the
ability to edit the titles of

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.050
highlights after creating
them.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.880
And, and it&#39;s,

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.940
it&#39;s, the, this was like, this
stuff was really consistent.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.900
As we talked to broadcasters,

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.430
you probably talked to 12 fif,
fo, 14, something like that

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.260
broadcasters from the
Justin.tv gaming platform.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.940
We got, we got all this
feedback and,

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.980
you know, what else do we
have?

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.170
We have your, your competitors
have all these cool features

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.950
like polls and scrolling text,
you, I can personalize chat

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.890
there and so, we have some
positive feedback.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.346
They&#39;re like, oh, you guys
don&#39;t have ads, that&#39;s great.

00:27:22.346 --> 00:27:23.980
I need to be able to ban.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.280
So, a bunch of stuff around
chat.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.180
A bunch of stuff around
interactivity with,

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:33.920
with interactivity with the
with their viewers.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.310
And, that was all really
interesting.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.940
So, this was what the, this is
what the Justin TV

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.270
broadcasters wanted us to
build.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.640
And, this is what they, what,

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.310
what, where they felt pain
using the, using the product.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.860
And so, if you thought that
what we

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.800
did was going to address these
problems, you would be wrong.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.140
Because, actually, people who
are using your service already

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.720
and are willing to put up with
all these issues, kind of,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.250
kind of means that

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.980
these are probably not
actually the biggest problems.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.780
Because if you&#39;re willing to
ignore the fact that you can&#39;t

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.870
edit the band lesson, titles
are uneditable, and

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.490
there&#39;s no way to get trolls
out of your channel.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.000
And, you&#39;re using the service
anyways,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.280
maybe those aren&#39;t huge
problems.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.240
And so, that sort of

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.370
brings up another really
important point.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:13.200
Which is, you have to compare
you have to

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.070
compare groups of people, and

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:17.020
compare the level at which
they they argued with us.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.565
So, if you go to the next
slide yes.

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:22.700
Nice.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.150
We got competitor broadcaster
feedback,

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:25.300
which is really interesting.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.680
So, this is stuff that you&#39;ve,
we heard a lot from people who

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.110
are using other broadcast
platforms.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.460
They wanted to be able to
switch multiple people onto

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.500
their channel at the same
time.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.400
they, they complained about us
not

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.900
having a rev share program or
they talked a lot

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.300
about how they&#39;re trying to
make a living.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.140
They really wanted to make
money pursuing this

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.880
pursuing this gaming
broadcasting thing.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.900
And, they talked a lot about
video stability.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.410
Our service wasn&#39;t good in
Europe specifically but, but

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.840
just globally, video stability
is this huge,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.490
huge issue for them.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:01.080
And if you compare and

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.000
contrast actually, it was
really different.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.800
Like, the things that people
who

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.830
didn&#39;t use our service said
about what they cared about,

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.670
was completely different from
the things that people who

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.400
were using the service cared
about.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.100
And we focused on this stuff
because this was

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.000
the stuff where, it was so bad
that they

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.730
weren&#39;t even willing to use
our service because of it.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.750
And most of

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.680
them actually had thought
about this because we were,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.090
our user base happened to be a
very well educated user base

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.330
in the area who knew about all
their options for, for this.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.840
And, they would, they
actually, you know,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.610
reaching out to them meant
they could,

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.290
they probably already tried
all four services and

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:33.990
actually had an opinion.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.780
It&#39;s great when you can users
who are that,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.920
that informed and that,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.810
that, they have understand the
space that well.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.290
And and if you go to the.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.791
I&#39;m just going to go to the
next slide.

00:29:43.791 --> 00:29:44.520
Yeah.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.500
Here we go.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.780
The other big thing we did
that I thought was

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.210
really important was we talked
to non-broadcasters.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.140
so, we went up there and

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.860
we talked to all the people
who weren&#39;t using us

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.040
or competitors.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.720
And in many ways,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.960
those are the most important
people, right?

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.970
Talking to your competitor&#39;s,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:00.320
that&#39;s your short term win,
right?

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.440
Someones using a competing,
piece of competing software

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.270
unless your piece of competing
software is something like

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.900
Google, which is a search
engine, which everyone uses,.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.480
Okay.
Then,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.460
there are no non-users to
convert.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.840
But, in the case of gaming
broadcasting,

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.360
almost everyone&#39;s a non-user,
right?

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.660
The, the majority, this is
true for most new products.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.210
The majority of people you&#39;re
computing with are non-users.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.330
They are people who have never
used your service before.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.960
And, what they say is actually
the most important.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.090
What they say is, is the thing
that blocks you from expanding

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.870
from a, a, expanding the size
of

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.420
the market with your features,
right?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.090
If you, all you do is look at
your competitors and

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.780
yourself, and all you do is
talk to your,

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.620
you know, your people who use
your competitors products.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.920
People who use your products.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.610
You can never expand.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.220
Well, not never.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.220
But, you&#39;re not learning the
things that help you

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.840
expand the size of the market.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.720
You want to talk to people who
aren&#39;t even trying to use

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.870
one of these things, yet.

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:49.920
Who, who have thought about
it, maybe.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.430
But, who aren&#39;t who aren&#39;t
into it.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.960
So, what did they say?

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.920
My computer isn&#39;t fast enough.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.430
I&#39;m focused on training 12
hours a day for

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.100
the next tournament.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.230
I like making the perfect
video, and like, editing it.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.320
And so, I just upload things
to YouTube.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.150
I don&#39;t do live streaming.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.750
I don&#39;t, I, I, I have no
desire to,

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.650
to go into that space.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.240
or, or this is actually,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.270
particularly in Korea, this is
a big problem.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.010
Once our strategy gets
broadcast in

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.620
a major tournament, we have to
start over.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.770
We have to like, come up with
an entirely new strategy.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.890
And so, the last thing we
ever&#39;d want to do would be

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.134
broadcast our practice
sessions, are you crazy?

00:31:22.134 --> 00:31:24.284
That&#39;s going to hurt us in the
next big tournament.

00:31:24.284 --> 00:31:25.113
And so, this became,

00:31:25.113 --> 00:31:26.511
this became a big outreach
program for

00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:28.621
us, trying to figure out how
we can get people over this.

00:31:28.621 --> 00:31:30.055
We bought people computers.

00:31:30.055 --> 00:31:31.661
We ,.

00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:34.021
We worked really closely with
gaming broadcast,

00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:35.714
software companies to help,
the who,

00:31:35.714 --> 00:31:38.880
who made the broadcasting
software to make that better.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.970
We started building
broadcasting into games and

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.730
into platforms, like we built
broadcasting into the Xbox,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.510
we built broadcasting into the
Playstation 4.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.050
Because we wanted,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.450
needed to overcome this issue
that, like,

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.440
it was too hard, broadcasting
wasn&#39;t, wasn&#39;t possible.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.380
And so you sort of combine
these, for us, these

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.460
are three, three big groups we
looked at for broadcasting.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.390
And you combine that feedback
and

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.080
what it tells you is not the
features to build.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.470
Right?
Because the, the features they

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.370
asked for things like polls
things like

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:13.860
a you know, the ability to
have child account.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.600
Like, child accounts in your
account.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.769
We haven&#39;t built most of that
stuff.

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.150
But what was important were
the, were the, the issues,

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.180
like the goals they were
trying to accomplish there.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.130
People wanted money.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.550
People wanted stability and
quality.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.150
People wanted universal access
for

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.420
viewers all around the world
to be able to watch them.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.470
And so that became our focus,
actually.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.560
And we dumped almost all of
our resources into things that

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.370
none, no one ever mentioned in
an interview.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.990
But, those are the things that
actually address the problem.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.520
And, and the way you could
tell that it worked is, was as

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.410
we, we would build these
things, and then we would go

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.730
back to this exact same people
we interviewed and say hey,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.540
you told us you really cared a
lot about making money.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.720
Well, we built you this
subscription program,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.180
that will let you make money.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.550
And, it, it, it&#39;s astonishing
because most people aren&#39;t,

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.940
have never had that
experience, actually.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.030
They&#39;ve never talked to
someone and

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.140
said it would be really great
if your product had feature X.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.960
And then, and then, like, two
months later or

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.160
a month later, your product
actually has feature X.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.750
Or at the very least,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.420
a feature that addresses the
problem they brought up.

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.830
And so, it was actually, the,

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.280
the people we converted first
to our

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.170
product are the people that we
talk to about user research.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.420
They are the ones who were
actually the most impressed,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.640
which is kind of fun.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.110
But it really worked, because
those,

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.490
we picked people who are
representative.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.290
We picked big broadcasters,
small ones, medium ones.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.300
And we, we made sure we were
addressing their concerns.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.000
And that, that was completely
different from how we&#39;d

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.130
approach the problem on
JustinTV.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.470
Because in JustinTV, when we&#39;d
try to do this,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.190
we&#39;d, we&#39;d sat down.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.930
We trolled through huge
amounts of data.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.630
Like we, we spent tons of time
looking at Google Analytics.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:45.600
Looking at mixed panel.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.820
Looking at in-house analytics
tools.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.470
Figuring out how people use
the service.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.950
Looking at where our traffic
came from.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.550
Completion rates on flows.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:54.930
We spent all this time doing
that.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.880
And that&#39;s good, I mean, you
can learn things from that.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.220
I&#39;m not telling you not to
look at your at your data.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.790
But it doesn&#39;t tell you where
you need to go.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.700
It doesn&#39;t tell you where,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.880
what the problems are you need
to address.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.800
And so we would just sort of
invent these ideas in

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.900
JustinTV.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.180
And then, nine times out of
ten,

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.600
without talking to someone,
the idea turns out to be bad.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.420
And that&#39;s just one of those
disappointing things about

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.150
doing user interviews and user
feedback.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.060
It&#39;s why, I think, so many
people don&#39;t do it, which is,

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.270
you&#39;re going to get negative
news about your,

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:25.830
your favorite pet feature most
of the time.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.570
Like, you&#39;re going to have
this great idea,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.510
and you&#39;re going to talk to
the user, and it&#39;s going to

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.150
turn out that that nobody
actually wants that.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.070
Like no, no one&#39;s actually,
they&#39;re actually completely

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.410
concerned about completely
different things and

00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:38.790
they don&#39;t care about what you
thought was important at all.

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.790
And and that&#39;s a little bit
sad but just, just think about

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.790
how sad you&#39;d be in four
months when you launched that

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.280
feature and it turns out no
one actually wants to use it.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.960
So think that&#39;s about it for

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.290
my the lecture section of what
we&#39;re we&#39;re talking about.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.260
I want to take some questions
from the audience.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.340
&gt;&gt; What you see startups get
most wrong about?

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.090
I mean, most startups don&#39;t do
them at all, but

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.560
the ones that do what are the
most common mistakes?

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.670
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d say, the most common
mistakes are,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.230
showing people your product.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.820
don&#39;t, don&#39;t show them you&#39;re
product.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.350
It&#39;s, it&#39;s sort of like
telling them about a feature,

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.410
you want to learn about what&#39;s
already in their heads, your,

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.480
you want to avoid putting
things there.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.850
The other thing is, asking
about your,

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.310
your pet feature direction, so
if you think you want to add,

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.440
add subscriptions to your
product.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.430
Going and asking people would
you pay for a subscription.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.980
Going and asking them, would
you use this feature.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.820
And I&#39;d say the the other big
mistake people make is

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.620
talking to who&#39;s available
rather than talking to

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.850
who they need to talk to.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.544
There&#39;s certain users that are
really easy to get at,

00:35:44.544 --> 00:35:49.617
because they are say, members
of your forum already.

00:35:49.617 --> 00:35:51.320
Right?
You have some product forum,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.680
and you talk to the users on
that forum because they&#39;re,

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.750
they&#39;re easier to get access
to.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.130
we, we spent like weeks
digging for

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:59.090
identity information, and

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.350
figuring who these people
were.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.520
So we could contact them, so
we could talk to them.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.200
Because a lot of these people
weren&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t obvious.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.260
They were just some user on a,
on a site.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.390
And if that site didn&#39;t
support messaging, there was,

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:10.880
like, no obvious way to
interact with them.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.140
And so we spent a bunch of
time trying to network, and

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.930
find those users, and bring
them on.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.760
Because if you, if you just
talk to who&#39;s easy to talk to,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.570
you&#39;re not really getting,
getting the best data.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.760
The fortunate side there is
that almost everyone is

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.704
flattered to be asked what
they think.

00:36:26.704 --> 00:36:30.082
And so most of them will
actually talk to you and

00:36:30.082 --> 00:36:31.268
tell you things.

00:36:31.268 --> 00:36:32.140
Yeah?

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:32.690
&gt;&gt; How hard is it to

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.180
get buy in from the rest of
your company?

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.120
I mean, like, you can go and

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.140
be like, whatever, I&#39;m in
charge.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.300
So you&#39;re doing what I say.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.395
But it&#39;s probably not the best
way of doing it.

00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:42.270
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; So how did you get them to?

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:43.280
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a good question.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.180
So the question is how hard is
it to get buy in

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.380
from the rest of the company
and how do you do it?

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.960
Getting buy in if you just go
to them and

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.380
say, I figured out, I talked
to the user,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.860
I figured it out we have to
build this.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.340
Is really hard.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.410
Because people don&#39;t trust
you.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.980
There&#39;s something magic about
showing them in

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.600
the interview though.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.990
So I really recommend you
record interviews.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.340
Recording interviews is like
magic.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.340
A, it stops you from taking
notes in the middle.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.850
And taking notes is a little
bit disruptive.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.120
It makes it harder for you to

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.400
feel like you&#39;re actually
engaged in the conversation.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.710
And b, you can then play that
recording for people.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.670
So when, when they don&#39;t have
to be there for

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.550
the entirety of all of the
interviews.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.830
But when you want to make a
point about what,

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.368
what we should be building and
why.

00:37:21.368 --> 00:37:24.380
You just playback for the rest
of the company that interview

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.040
and it&#39;s it&#39;s like magic the
influence it has on people&#39;s

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.420
thoughts and what&#39;s what the
right thing to build is.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.430
Yes.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.001
&gt;&gt; Since you mentioned
recording did you try to

00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:36.557
insist on

00:37:36.557 --> 00:37:39.620
doing Skype interviews rather
than over email or?

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.710
&gt;&gt; What was your impression
of?

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So you definitely want to do

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.300
Skype or sorry the question
was,

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.110
do we insist on Skype
interviews for recording.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.230
You don&#39;t want to

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.330
do interviews over email if
you can avoid it

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.420
because interviews over email
are non interactive.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.710
And the most interesting
things you learn in

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.240
interviews come from the
interesting, tell me more.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.740
because the instant that you
hit, you hope this vein of

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.110
they&#39;ll say something you
didn&#39;t expect, and

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.780
the instant they say something
you didn&#39;t expect or didn&#39;t

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.270
already know, you should drop
into detective mode, and

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.730
detective mode is huh, that&#39;s
interesting.

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.230
Can you tell me more about
that?

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.310
And people don&#39;t like silence,
so

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:16.300
they&#39;ll keep talking to fill
the void.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.020
And the best part about doing
it over Skype or

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.940
doing it in person is you have
that interactive feedback.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.245
And you can actually pull a
lot more out of people.

00:38:25.245 --> 00:38:26.920
E-mail interviews are, they&#39;re
okay.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.750
But they&#39;re basically useless.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.370
If you&#39;re in person or

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.090
over Skype, they&#39;re actually
also easy to record.

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.150
Make sure you ask them if it&#39;s
okay to record it.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.240
It&#39;s not polite to record
people without their consent.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.710
But if they&#39;re willing to like
give you like an in,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.800
a user interview, they&#39;re
probably willing for

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.560
you to record it as well.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.280
&gt;&gt; Sorry, but what about the
international market?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.852
Like you mentioned if that you
had a lot of

00:38:45.852 --> 00:38:47.342
interviews in Korea, and

00:38:47.342 --> 00:38:50.613
I don&#39;t know maybe feel
comfortable with English, or.

00:38:50.613 --> 00:38:52.991
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question is
like what about people in

00:38:52.991 --> 00:38:55.088
the international market where
you&#39;re trying to do

00:38:55.088 --> 00:38:57.630
youth interviews with people
who don&#39;t speak your language.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.510
That&#39;s just really hard.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.280
And actually to this day
Twitch works way better in

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:02.690
English speaking countries
than it

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.970
does in non English speaking
countries.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.880
And I think a big part of that
is, we are much better at

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.510
talking to people in English
speaking countries, and

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.480
learning what their needs are.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.360
And we&#39;re not as good at it,
in other countries.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.210
We&#39;ve tried to address that by

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.120
hiring people who speak
Korean.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:14.950
Having them translate.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.650
We&#39;ve tried to address that
by, finding representative

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.920
people in those countries who
speak both English and

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.370
Korean, and reaching out to
them.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.350
But the problem with that, is,
like the, you&#39;re

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.890
not actually getting a
representative sample.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:29.220
No matter how hard you try.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.730
The very fact that they are a
fluent English

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.220
speaker means they&#39;re not
representative of

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.400
all the people who don&#39;t speak
fluent English.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.690
It&#39;s just a hard problem.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.510
It&#39;s why companies find it
easier to wi,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.720
build markets that went in
their home,

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.950
in their home country.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.050
Much more easily than abroad.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.760
Because it&#39;s really hard to
talk to users abroad.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.450
Yes.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:51.069
&gt;&gt; What channels did you use
to reach out to them, and

00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:53.390
do you ever compensate them?

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.520
&gt;&gt; So the channels we used to,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.850
what channels did we use to
reach out to them and

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:57.140
what did we ever compensate
them?

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.460
The channels we used to reach
out to them,

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.820
were, on site messaging
systems.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.330
So like, if you&#39;re, most site
websites have some way to

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.030
contact the user, so if
they&#39;re a visible user of

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.640
another website you use that
sites messaging system and

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.150
say hey, I was watching your
stream, or

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.290
whatever this person was doing
on the site.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:17.740
I&#39;d love to ask you some
questions about your use

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.780
would you mind hopping on a
Skype call?

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.710
And as for, the other thing we
do is we find out who people

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.029
were and we send them emails.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.760
we&#39;d, like, rented some at
events.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.370
because a lot of these people
go to the same events and we,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.400
like, would go to the events
and,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.520
like, get, we wouldn&#39;t run the
user interview at the event,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.930
but you get to know them, you
exchange business cards or,

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.070
you know, whatever it is you
actually do now aren&#39;t,

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:38.290
isn&#39;t business cards.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.560
And, and you, you get in touch
with them.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.950
We tended not to compensate
people.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.310
I think that if you, if no,

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.910
if people don&#39;t care enough
about the problem to,

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.640
like, talk to someone who&#39;s
trying to solve it.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.920
You&#39;re probably barking up the
wrong tree.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.240
We never had any trouble
getting people to

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.400
talk to us about paying them.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.340
&gt;&gt; What about on site user
feedback tools?

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.864
Do you get a little feedback
from that?

00:41:00.864 --> 00:41:03.373
&gt;&gt; So, so there&#39;s this whole
second set of user feedback

00:41:03.373 --> 00:41:07.100
that&#39;s really important, that
I should talk about,.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:07.610
The question was,

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.020
what about, like, on site user
feedback tools?

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.690
And I think this stuff you&#39;re
talking about is

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.420
where you have like a, a new
product and

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.710
you want to see how, if it&#39;s
actually going to work or not.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:17.840
And so you put it in front of
people and

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.270
you see how they use it or
not.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.410
That&#39;s really important.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.130
That kind of work is super
important and

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.020
it can tell you lots of things
about where you went wrong

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.250
building something before you
launch it, which is great.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.960
It doesn&#39;t tell you what to
build.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.010
It it helps you iron out the
kinks and

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.810
edges of the thing you did
build.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:38.520
But generally speaking we that
wasn&#39;t kind of the user

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.180
feedback we were getting I
mean that&#39;s stuffs good

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.000
it&#39;s good it&#39;s like it&#39;s much
more similar to the,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.480
to the data driven approach.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.545
Right?
You&#39;re finding out,

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:47.829
why are people dropping off in
this flow, you&#39;re not

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:50.216
finding out what problems
should I really be solving for

00:41:50.216 --> 00:41:52.477
them, and what, what do they
care about as a human.

00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:53.010
And, for

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.007
this kind of like really early
stages interview which

00:41:56.007 --> 00:41:59.484
the kind of user interview
that&#39;s crucial startups do,.

00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:01.536
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s the, that&#39;s where
you want to focus, so

00:42:01.536 --> 00:42:03.038
we didn&#39;t bring on site
actually it

00:42:03.038 --> 00:42:04.401
almost all over phone or
Skype.

00:42:06.275 --> 00:42:06.991
Yes.

00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:09.592
&gt;&gt; So for the three different
groups of people there are

00:42:09.592 --> 00:42:12.547
different kinds of feedback so
as a startup time and

00:42:12.547 --> 00:42:15.045
resources, is that a good area
to focus on first?

00:42:15.045 --> 00:42:15.632
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So

00:42:15.632 --> 00:42:18.375
with the three different kinds
of people did we focused on

00:42:18.375 --> 00:42:21.830
one of them given that we had
very limited resources, yes.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.680
We focused on the competing
people using

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.510
competing products.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.180
Because, we knew that they
already were interested in

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.220
the behavior that we needed
and

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.685
they were willing to do it at
all.

00:42:33.685 --> 00:42:36.210
And therefore all we had to do
is convince them to switch,

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.880
which is a much easier thing
to do than to try to

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.840
create new behavior where none
existed before.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.600
And we had to do that because
we had to get some quick wins,

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.545
because my gaming project
inside of

00:42:45.545 --> 00:42:46.990
Justin.tv would have been
killed if it wasn&#39;t

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.570
showing 25% month over month
growth every single month.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.450
So we did, and that meant
focusing on

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.990
short term get the people in
right now.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.800
And that turned out to be good
in general because it turns

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.400
out that building something
that some people want

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.230
generally generalizes and so I
want to bring in

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.780
people who weren&#39;t even users
of the service as well.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.040
Yes.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.622
&gt;&gt; Twitch has been around from
the beginning so

00:43:10.622 --> 00:43:12.510
it filled up, for example the
video game industry.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.141
In the beginning this industry
was very like, decentralized,

00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.526
like there wasn&#39;t a lot of
cohesion with like, you know,

00:43:17.526 --> 00:43:18.403
different video game

00:43:18.403 --> 00:43:21.110
companies consolidating where
tournaments are and stuff.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.290
But now it&#39;s very different.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.980
So you said originally you
spoke to like broadcasters and

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.170
you know streamers themselves,
how does that change when

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:32.950
like, for example like Riot
has you know, banned users or

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.088
professional players from
streaming their own stuff.

00:43:35.088 --> 00:43:37.240
Have you tried to you know,
gain leverage with that or?

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question is

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.290
what about the game publishers
basically, right?

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.280
The game publishers is huge

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.520
important people in this
space.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:45.890
a, the game publisher is and
any big company for

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.670
that matter isn&#39;t going to
give you the time of day as

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.060
a small start up.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.980
Which is both good and bad.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.005
It means you don&#39;t really
need,

00:43:52.005 --> 00:43:53.428
need to talk to them because,

00:43:53.428 --> 00:43:56.380
they&#39;re they&#39;re not interested
in you.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.370
But it means you actually just
can&#39;t talk to them,

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.840
I mean we tried but no one
wanted to talk to us.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.350
And they did once we started
getting some traction and, and

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.140
becoming a little bit,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.348
slightly bit of a player in
the space.

00:44:07.348 --> 00:44:08.645
I don&#39;t want to like, talk
that bad about of them

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:11.560
because they, they, they were
nice about it enough about it

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.790
it&#39;s just that you know, when
you&#39;re, when you&#39;re

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.990
a tiny little start up there&#39;s
lots of tiny start ups and

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.470
they, they don&#39;t have the time
to talk to all of you.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.380
As we&#39;ve gotten bigger
actually the point that,

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.630
you know, game publishers have

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.290
become an increasingly
important constituency for us.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.310
And if I was to talk about who
Twitch does user interviews

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:31.530
with now, who we who we pulled
information from now it would

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.920
include game publishers
definitely because they&#39;d be,

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.570
they&#39;ve become much more
active in the space.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.600
It was something that they
weren&#39;t particularly active

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.640
three or four years ago as
much as they are now.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.017
And that&#39;s another really
important point about user

00:44:42.017 --> 00:44:42.950
interviews in general.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.533
Which is that the pool of
people you care about is

00:44:44.533 --> 00:44:45.410
going to shift over time.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:47.620
The people who get you
started,

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.540
like the crucial people to get
your product started for

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.940
the first six months,

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.720
are not who will be using it
three years later.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.460
And it&#39;s very important you
keep, doing this stuff.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.700
Because one thing that&#39;s
really easy to do,

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.450
is to do a little bit of it in
the beginning.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:02.105
And, and achieve some level of
success, and then you sort of,

00:45:02.105 --> 00:45:03.540
stop talking to new people.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.560
And that&#39;s a good way to make
the, the next set of

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.760
features you build be not as
good as the first ones.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.284
&gt;&gt; How about one more
question?

00:45:09.284 --> 00:45:09.953
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:45:09.953 --> 00:45:10.809
Yes?

00:45:10.809 --> 00:45:14.785
&gt;&gt; How do you give good user
feedback, if you&#39;re a user?

00:45:14.785 --> 00:45:16.996
&gt;&gt; so, how do you give good
user feedback,

00:45:16.996 --> 00:45:18.693
it&#39;s a really good question.

00:45:18.693 --> 00:45:23.276
So I think what I, what I want
a user to do is I

00:45:23.276 --> 00:45:28.092
want a user to tell me about
what they, like,

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:32.147
what they&#39;re really thinking,
right?

00:45:32.147 --> 00:45:34.831
And what, what, what they&#39;re
problems really are.

00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:36.430
And to just sort of ramble.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:37.500
Like I want someone to just
tell,

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.230
tell me about stuff in their
life.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.580
Because the, the more you
learn about them as a person.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.020
And sort of the, the, their,

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.784
what&#39;s going on in the context
of what they&#39;re doing the is

00:45:48.784 --> 00:45:52.430
easier to understand why they
want the things they want.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.770
And that&#39;s really the critical
question.

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.600
So I&#39;d say like, you know,
what I&#39;m looking for in a,

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.710
in someone, when I&#39;m doing a
user interview, it&#39;s someone

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.220
who is going to be willing to
talk a lot and be willing to,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.130
to really give me a full, give
me a full picture.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.200
So that&#39;s what, I guess on the
flip side,

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.614
if you want to be a good, if
you want to help people out

00:46:10.614 --> 00:46:13.778
with good user interview
feedback ramble, like, be,

00:46:13.778 --> 00:46:16.276
just, just talk about stuff
and everything.

00:46:16.276 --> 00:46:17.138
All right, great.

00:46:17.138 --> 00:46:17.874
Well, thank you very much.

00:46:17.874 --> 00:46:18.527
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

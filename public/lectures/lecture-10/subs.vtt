WEBVTT

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:06.290
Set the stage with a few
slides and some comments.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.240
But, the main stage is gonna
be with Brian.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.980
When he comes up and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.556
talks about how he built the
airbnb culture.

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:15.050
So you&#39;re here you,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.210
I&#39;ve been following the
presentations.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.600
And so, now you know how to
get started.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.880
You&#39;ve built a team.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.030
You start to sort of build
your product.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.100
It&#39;s off the ground, it&#39;s
growing.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.480
People love it, you figured
out how to do that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.060
You figured out how to
create a very special one of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.480
a kind company with monopoly
powers that&#39;s big,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.055
and the market that you&#39;re
chasing after

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:39.870
is slightly bigger than the
paper air plane business so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.930
you&#39;re good, right?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.120
So, now what?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540
So, we&#39;re here to submit
that actually culture is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.340
the thing that&#39;s gonna be
very, very important for

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.890
you to be able to scale the
business.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.920
As well as your team.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.980
And hopefully,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.620
after this talk you&#39;ll be
able to know what,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.080
what is culture?

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.040
Why does it matter?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.350
How to sort of create your
core values and think about

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.730
elements that sort of fit
together for a core values

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.860
in the culture that create a
high performance team.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.750
And get some best practices
for the culture.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.420
So, what is culture?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.620
Anybody have a, wanna take a
guess at what,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.080
how one should define this?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.950
&gt;&gt; A set of values
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s good.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.550
Did you look that up on the,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.300
because you had a computer
and Internet connection.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.460
Did you just look it up?

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.420
So these are some
definitions, that,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.290
you&#39;ll find, in, in
Webster&#39;s dictionary.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.970
And.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.910
But that, that.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.592
We&#39;re at Stanford.

00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:37.810
This is kind of a trick
question, it&#39;s a CS class.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.900
Questions are never
straightforward.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.020
The real question is, what
is company culture gonna be?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.510
You know, culture that we
can

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.730
generally talk about
society.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.460
About groups.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.250
About places or things.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.030
Here we&#39;re talking about
company culture.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.300
And so how do one define
company culture?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.980
We can take the previous
definition and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.500
modify it a little bit.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.280
And so every, this is a hint
of how we may want to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.650
define company culture.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.590
Everyday blank and blank of
each member of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.850
the team in pursuit of our
company blank.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.820
And some people have filled
these in with different

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.850
sort of things.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.890
A, the first blank could be
assumptions,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.990
beliefs, values.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.720
My favorite is core values.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.430
The second blank for the B
blank.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.040
People have said behaviors.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.470
My favorite, sort of,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.650
answer to that is real
action, how do you act?

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.430
And in pursuit of goals,
that&#39;s kind of weak.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.540
in, in, in pursuit of big
and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.070
hairy audacious goals,
that&#39;s a little stronger.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.790
But a better definition is
in pursuit of the mission.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.040
So.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860
Now that, sort of, we have
that definition,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.950
what do we do with it and
why does it matter?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.140
This is a quote from Gandhi,

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.990
your beliefs become your
thoughts.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.540
Your thoughts become your
words.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.890
Your words become your
actions.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.060
And your actions become your
habits.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.020
And your habits become your
values.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.760
Your values become your
destiny.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.260
If you don&#39;t have a good
culture in the company,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.520
you can&#39;t pursue your
destiny.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.530
Why it matters is it, it
becomes the first principles

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.130
that you sort of go back to
when you make decisions.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.130
It becomes a way to align
people on values that

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.010
matter to the company.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.040
It provides a certain level
of

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.180
stability to fall back on
and it provides a level of

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.610
trust that people can sort
of trust each other with.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.540
It also give you a list of

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.160
things that you should be
able to.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.240
Figure out what to do and
what not to do and what

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.450
the more important thing
about that is what not to do

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.860
And then finally the other
thing that is important is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.740
it allows you to retain the
right employees.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.350
There are people in this
world that are not gonna be

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.830
a fit for your company but
if you have good strong

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.120
culture and good strong core
values you&#39;ll know who you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.900
wanna retain and who you do
not wanna retain.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.600
And if you took the,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.510
take the first words the
first letter of those it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.090
happens to help you move
faster.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.650
Another reason.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.660
You&#39;re thinking that&#39;s like
all mushy stuff.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.680
This is actually more
scientific stuff.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.280
So here are indices for,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.430
from 1997 to 2003 of stock
market index of companies.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.280
And the S&amp;P 500 and the
Russell 3000 and

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.760
then for the Fortune 100
best companies to work for.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.800
They survey all these
companies out there and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.420
they&#39;ve picked out companies
that they

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.770
believe are the best
companies to work for.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.730
And, the returns, the stock
market returns of

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.020
those companies happens to
be 11.8%, 11.08%,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.160
which is almost twice that
of the other two indices.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.735
And so, there&#39;s real power
in companies that treat

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.369
their employees well, where
there is a lot of trust,

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.310
where there is a lot of
strong culture.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.190
So, how do you sort of
create a, a set of values,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.080
and, and sort of define the
culture et cetera.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.300
I get asked that a lot.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.260
You got to start with the
leader of the company,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.430
the founder.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.940
And, so ask yourself, what
are the personal values that

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.810
are most important to you?

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.580
What are those things that
are most important to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.060
the business?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.130
Who are the types of people
you like working with and

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.620
what are their values?

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.320
And, through that,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.010
you sort of distill together
what a set of values are.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.350
And think about all the
people that you&#39;ve

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.470
never liked working with,
what values they have.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.330
Think about the opposite of
that, and maybe those should

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.820
be considered values for,
for your company.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.689
And, finally, remember this,

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.290
the values have to support
your mission.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.110
And, if it doesn&#39;t support
your mission,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.570
you&#39;re missing something.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.800
And, and then the last,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.990
final chapter, they have to
be credible and

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.410
they have to be uniquely
tied to your mission.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.300
So, at Zappos, in terms of
uniquely applied to

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.290
the mission, we&#39;re focused
on creating a culture that

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.550
was gonna provide great
customer service.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.480
So the first core value we
had was to deliver.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.590
While through service.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.260
We&#39;re very specific that we
want to

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.740
deliver great customer
service.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.850
And it was gonna be a wild
experience.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.060
And then, below that,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.030
we want to sort of add a
paragraph supporting that.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.710
Talking about exactly what
we mean by that.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.650
We want it to support them,
deliver while through

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.340
service, and support people,
such as our employees,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.550
our customers, and our brand
partners, and our investors.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.030
In terms of the opposite
thing, we generally didn&#39;t

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.820
like working with arrogant
people.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.649
So, one of our core values
that&#39;s that was,

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.150
was to be humble.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.030
So those are two examples
where we sort of

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.600
create a core values in a
way that sort of, sort of,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.700
became credible and uniquely
tied to our mission.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.210
So, you go through this
process,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.800
you come up with a few core
values.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.980
These might be some of them.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.840
Whether it&#39;s honestly,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.570
integrity, service, teamwork
and they might be a list of,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.570
you might start with three.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.570
You might end up with a list
of ten.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.040
You might list, list of 30.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.490
It&#39;s a good start.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.010
And when Zappos went through
this process we started with

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.200
like, we asked all the
employees at the time,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.480
what core values they wanna
identify with,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.560
we came up with 37.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.270
We initially, we sort of
whittled it down to

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.900
about ten.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.130
And it took a year to do
this.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.800
That&#39;s a long time and you
might wanna ask why.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.570
Well, if you just come up
with the word honesty,

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.400
I mean give me a break
everybody wants

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.270
the culture to be honest.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.850
Now you.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.860
Nobody is going to say I
want to be lied to everyday.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.690
service.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.710
What do you mean by service?

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.710
There&#39;s gotta be a lot more
depth in this than that.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.840
And nobody, everybody talks
about teamwork.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.510
But there&#39;s a difference in
level of

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.900
team work that you see in a
intramural sports team as

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.740
versus a baseball team.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.439
And so how do you sort of
dive deeper into team work.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:44.660
What are the things that
don&#39;t work on for a team?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.450
A lot of it has to do with
communications.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.090
A lot of it has to

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.170
do with things that people
have studied.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.200
And you might want to go
deeper into that.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.290
At Zappos we thought about
well there

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.390
are a lot of smart people in
this room.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.100
When they&#39;re fighting with
each and

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.120
trying to figure out whose
right and whose not.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.400
It&#39;s probably not the best
use of time.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.240
And we want everybody to
sort of riff off each other

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.920
and help each other make any
idea better.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.350
The result is that the
company gets a better idea,

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.540
not that any individual
person is right.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.130
So we wanted to instill this
idea that

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.410
it&#39;s company first,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.230
then your department, then
your team, then yourself.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.228
And how do you do that?

00:08:20.228 --> 00:08:23.690
Gonna go a, ano, a level a
little deeper than that.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.290
There&#39;s another,

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.280
there&#39;s a great sort of sort
of element of

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.460
high performing teams that I
really like which is this

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.090
pyramid that was created by
Patrick Lencioni and

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.460
he wrote this book The Five
Dysfunctions of a Team and

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.810
the reason this is
interesting is he

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.440
talks about the breakdowns
of a teams.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.060
First of all if you don&#39;t.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.620
A lot of teams break down
because they don&#39;t have

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.730
any trust.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.800
Then, even if you had trust,
why do you need trust?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.850
Well, then if you have trust
you can actually have

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.738
debates and conflict and get
to the right answer.

00:08:54.738 --> 00:08:58.570
If you don&#39;t have conflict
and debate, people are just,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.910
it&#39;s the blind leading the
blind.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.340
How do you know you actually
got to

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.730
the right answer before you
sort of commit to something?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.470
So, people are not actually
willing to commit.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.680
They&#39;re afraid of
committing.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.870
And so let&#39;s say you get to
the next level and

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.900
you are actually able to
commit.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.010
Well what, what goes wrong
then?

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.920
It&#39;s usually because people
are not held accountable to

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.830
things that they committed
to?

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.050
And if people are not held
accountable to the things

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.130
that they&#39;ve committed to,
then they can&#39;t get results.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:26.980
And I would submit to you,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.660
if you think about the
company as a black box,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.460
and results, whether it&#39;s
financial,

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.300
whether you produce a great
product,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.000
or anything like that as the
output.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.020
One of the major inputs is
the culture of the company.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.710
So some other best practices
we&#39;re gonna actually talk

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.290
about during Q and A because
I think this is gonna blend

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.920
into the conversation is
that you want to incorporate

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.500
your mission to values we&#39;ve
talked about that.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.310
Performance, you gotta think
harder,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.500
deeper, longer about your
values than

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.170
you might initially think
you need to do.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.700
One of the things I think
that a lot of

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.720
companies don&#39;t actually do
is they interview for

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.250
a technical fit or skill fit
or competency in that realm.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.960
But they don&#39;t actually
interview for

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.730
the culture fit, and

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.890
whether someone will
actually believe and

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.750
follow the mission.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.000
I think that&#39;s a big, big
no-no.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.140
Like I think you can have
the smartest engineer in

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.380
the world but, if they don&#39;t
believe in their mission.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.120
They&#39;re not gonna put their,
pour their heart and

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.700
soul into it.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.330
And that&#39;s one of the things
that where, if you actually

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.650
sorta start thinking about
culture from the interview

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.440
process to performance
reviews to making sure that

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.920
it&#39;s a daily habit, you&#39;ll
get a lot further with

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.970
produ, with, making a great
culture.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.290
The finally point on making
it, a daily habit, I think.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.500
Culture, just like customer
service or

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.110
fitness, is like mother had
an apple pie.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.270
Everybody wants to provide
great customer service.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.480
Every company wants to have
a great culture.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.440
What they fail to do is make
it a daily habit.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.760
You just can&#39;t be fit if
your,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.010
if you don&#39;t do it as a
daily habit.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.560
Eventually you get out of
shape,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.570
then you get fat, and then
you&#39;re like, oh,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.480
I got to go on a crash diet
to sort of

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.550
get back into shape.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.650
That doesn&#39;t quite work.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.920
And the same is true with
something like culture.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.660
So I think we checked all of
these off,

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.870
so we can go into Q and A
with Brian.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:21.380
&gt;&gt; All right.
Cool.

00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:30.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s good.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.540
&gt;&gt; All right.
Hello, everybody.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.180
It&#39;s quiet in here, I&#39;ll be
honest.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:35.880
Now it&#39;s better.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.560
Now, I feel less on edge.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.500
Nothing worst than a room
full of people really,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.260
really quiet, staring at
you, but now I feel better.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.570
&gt;&gt; I&#39;d say it for five, ten
minutes.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:44.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You could bare for

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.430
a little longer.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.300
So Brian.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.580
Talk about how the process
by which you came to

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.880
understand the culture was
important.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.030
&gt;&gt; So Airbnb and then
building the company.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.120
Yeah, so I think one of the
things we realize is so

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.290
just to give you.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.350
I won&#39;t tell the full story
of

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.810
everyone being some you may
know it, but.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.190
The very short version of
this story was that,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.460
Airbnb wasn&#39;t meant to be,
like,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.010
the company we were trying
to start.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.070
I had quit my job,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.360
I was complete, I was living
in LA.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.396
One day I drove to San
Francisco,

00:12:17.396 --> 00:12:20.743
became roommates with my,
friend from college,

00:12:20.743 --> 00:12:24.700
I went to Joe Gebia, and I
had $1,000 in the bank.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.934
And the rent was $1,150.

00:12:26.934 --> 00:12:28.864
So that weekend this
international design

00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:30.850
conference was coming to San
Francisco.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.020
All the hotels were sold
out.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.630
We had this idea,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.610
let&#39;s just turn our house
into a bed and

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.850
breakfast for the
conference.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.055
I didn&#39;t have any beds.

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:38.060
Joe had three air beds.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.080
We pulled them out of the
closets.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.410
We called it the air bed and
breakfast.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.490
That&#39;s how the company
started.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.910
I probably told that story
10,000 times, by the way.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.750
Some version of that story.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.810
And I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever
tell that a second time.

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:54.870
when, I, I remember growing
up, I, I also went to

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.830
college, and my parents were
social workers, and they had

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.370
kinda been nervous about me
going to art school.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.080
They kinda worried that
maybe I would like not

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.490
get a job after college,
which is I&#39;m sure a lot of

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.430
parents are worried about,
so she said, make sure you

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.180
promise you get a job with
health insurance.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.045
I ended up starting Air Bed
and

00:13:10.045 --> 00:13:11.680
Breakfast.com was the
original name.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.800
She remembered her telling
me I

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.252
guess you never got that job
with health insurance.

00:13:16.252 --> 00:13:18.070
The reason I say this though
is this.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:21.530
Airbnb was never meant to be
the big idea.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.160
It was meant to be the thing
to pay the rent so

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.230
we could think of the big
idea.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.850
And along the way by solving
our own problem,.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.050
It became the big idea.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.860
So alongside that and, and
I&#39;m not gonna

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.480
talk about like kind of how
he built the product.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.620
That&#39;s probably another
conversation that some other

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.920
people were talking about.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.470
You have to build a team in
a great company.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.220
And in the early days, we
had three co-founders, Joe,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.350
Nate and myself.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.330
And I kind of think of one
of

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.970
the reasons we&#39;re successful
was I was really lucky.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.560
And I don&#39;t think I was
really lucky because we

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.670
came up with the idea of
Airbnb.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.010
I don&#39;t think we&#39;re really
lucky that we

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.310
became successful once we
had the team.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.430
I think we could have come
up with a lot of ideas, and

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.230
been somewhat successful.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.350
I think I was lucky cuz I
found two great people that

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.470
I wanted to start a company
with.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.380
People I admired,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.260
that almost intimidated me
how talented,

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.460
how smart they were.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.990
And I think that&#39;s one of
the first things you got

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.080
to build a team that is so
talented that they kind of

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.850
almost make you slightly
uncomfortable because they

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.530
know by being with them
you&#39;re going to have to

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.540
raise your game to be with
them.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.280
And then when we were
working together in

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.260
the early days.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.170
This is like 2008.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.620
The first thing is we, we
were like a family.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.720
You think about founders.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.080
Founders are like parents
and the company is a child.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.950
And a child will manifest in
many ways behaviors that

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.370
parents have between their
relationship.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.920
If the parents are
dysfunctional.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.110
They&#39;re not working
together.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.180
Then the child&#39;s gonna be
frankly pretty fucked up.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.310
And so you don&#39;t want that.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.560
You want your culture to be
awesome.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.790
And so Joanie and

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.210
I, we&#39;re like total, total
family in the beginning.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.560
We worked 18 hours a day, 7
days a week.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.840
I remember when we&#39;re white
commentator.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.090
We like, worked together.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.500
We like, ate food together.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.040
We like, even went to the
gym together.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.280
We may as well have gotten
jump suits.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.260
We didn&#39;t go that far.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.897
But we were like.

00:14:51.897 --> 00:14:52.895
It was like we were on a
mission.

00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:55.263
I felt like we were like
special forces or something.

00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:58.397
And we had this like amazing
shared way of doing things.

00:14:58.397 --> 00:15:00.030
Amazing accountability.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.448
And then we realized that
was like the DNA of

00:15:03.448 --> 00:15:04.478
the company.

00:15:04.478 --> 00:15:07.041
And then, we started
thinking at some point you

00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:09.360
go from building the product
to phase two.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.900
Which is building the
company that

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.360
builds the product.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.960
And so a lot of the talk is
about how do

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.350
you build a product, how do
you get product market fit.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.040
Once people start doing that
now you&#39;ve got to

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.000
build a company.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.060
And it doesn&#39;t matter how
great your

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.700
original product or idea is
if you can&#39;t build

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.380
a great company then your
product will not endure.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.010
As we thought about this and
one of the things he

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.650
realized is we want to build
a company for the long term.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.970
The last thing is that I
want to build something,

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.740
I mean, think about it this
way.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.770
If, if your company like
your child,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.530
a parent wants his child to
outlive him or her.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.420
It would be a tragedy to
outlive your child.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.490
Also, I felt it would be a
tragedy for

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.700
us to outlive our company
and

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.670
just watch it rise and fall.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.290
We didn&#39;t want that.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.290
We wanted a company that
would endure.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.730
And so to do that, we
started

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.270
noticing companies have
something in common.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.550
Companies that were around
for

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.980
a really long time had a
clear mission.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.490
And they had a clear sense
of values.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.590
They had a shared way of
doing something that was

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.980
unique to them and was
really, really special.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.000
And so, then, Joanie and I,
when we were three people,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.040
decided to look around
companies.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.110
I noticed Apple, you know,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.360
Steve Jobs talked about his
core value as that he

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.480
believed people with passion
could change the world.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.020
And he said our products
change but

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.670
our value never had.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:15.000
And we learned about Amazon.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.930
We learned about Nike.

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.410
We learned about companies
in early days.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.350
You can even use this to
talk about organizations you

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.250
know even like a founding of
a,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.980
a nation has a strong values
and a declaration.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.470
Then the country might
endure longer.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.010
As we started realizing like
we need to have intention.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.590
Culture needs to be
designed.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.650
And that&#39;s kinda how we got
connected is because

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.400
you know, when we were
funded by Sequoia.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.420
Alfred Lin had just joined
from Zappos Sequoia.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.450
And I was told Zappos had an
amazing culture and

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.330
we went to Las Vegas and met
up with Tony and

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:44.870
we learned about it.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.410
&gt;&gt; And so what did you
learn.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.910
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.630
&gt;&gt; You guys were crazy.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.330
I, the, the thing we
learned.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.190
And we were three people
with you need to have,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.730
like, if culture&#39;s a shared
way of doing things,

00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.700
there&#39;s really two parts.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.860
One is behaviors and those
can kinda change, and

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.580
maybe 50 years from now
there will be rituals and

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.540
behaviors that will change,
be different.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.470
But there has to be some
things that never change.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.480
Some principles,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.610
some ideas that endure, that
make you, you.

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.010
And I think of core values
as integrity, honesty,

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.940
those aren&#39;t core values,

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.230
cuz they&#39;re values everyone
should have.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.940
They&#39;re, like, integrity
values.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.689
But would there have to be
like three, five,

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:22.010
six things that are unique
to you and

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.130
you can probably think about
this in your life.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.510
What is different about you
than

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.770
every single other person.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.576
If you could only tell
somebody three or

00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:31.080
four things, what do you
want them to know about you?

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.810
And we realized that when
Zappos has 100 employees,

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.870
they wrote down these nine
core, is it nine?

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.180
&gt;&gt; Ten, ten.
&gt;&gt; Ten, ten core values.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.850
And the only thing I learned
from Tony is you said I

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.620
wish I didn&#39;t wait until I
was a 100 employees-

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.370
&gt;&gt; To write down our core
values.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.090
So I think I was talking to
Sam he

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.460
says he thinks we&#39;re one of
the only companies that

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.780
wrote our core values down
before we hired anyone.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.120
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you
to hire a first employee?

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.370
&gt;&gt; So our first employee was
our first engineer.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.780
And I think we looked for
him for four or five months.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.050
And I probably interviewed,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.550
I probably looked through
thousands of people and

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.180
interviewed hundreds of
people.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.870
&gt;&gt; And by then, when you
hired the pro,

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.590
when did you write it?

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.520
Did you write it?
Did you write it

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.330
on day one or did you, was
it month three?

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.115
&gt;&gt; I think we started
working on it

00:18:12.115 --> 00:18:14.245
around the time of like
culminator,

00:18:14.245 --> 00:18:16.661
which would have been
January 2009.

00:18:16.661 --> 00:18:18.903
And it was probably a
process that evolved over

00:18:18.903 --> 00:18:20.980
the course of six to seven
months.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.307
We finished Y Combinator in
April 2009.

00:18:23.307 --> 00:18:25.770
I think we hired our first
engineer in July.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.370
Something like that.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.010
So it&#39;s probably like six
months.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.480
And the rea.
Cuz some people ask, like,

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.470
why did you spend so

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.320
much time on, like, hiring
your first engineer?

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.080
And here&#39;s how we thought
about it.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.960
I kinda felt like your first
engineer was

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.520
like bringing in DNA to your
company.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.690
This person was gonna, like,
there were gonna be a.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:42.950
If we were successful,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.560
there were gonna be 1,000
people just like him or

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.330
her in the company.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.060
And so, it wasn&#39;t a matter
of like,

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.090
getting somebody to build
the next three features that

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.690
we needed to ship for our
users.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.440
There was something much
more long-term and

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.620
much more enduring.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.810
Which was, do I wanna work
with a 100 or

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.230
a 1,000 more people like
this?

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.270
Now you want diversity but

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.340
you don&#39;t want, you want
diversity of like beliefs,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.830
you want diversity of like
backgrounds, age,.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.200
You don&#39;t want diversity of
values.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.400
You want a very, very
homogenous beliefs and

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.900
that&#39;s the one thing that
shouldn&#39;t be diverse.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.440
&gt;&gt; So what, what are
Airbnb&#39;s values?

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.300
&gt;&gt; We have six core values.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.240
I&#39;ll maybe talk about three
of them.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.070
&gt;&gt; So our first core value
that

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.190
we talk about is champion
the mission.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.260
And what it really means is
that we want to

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.290
hire people that are here
for a mission.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.100
We don&#39;t want people here
because they think we&#39;ve got

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.810
a great valuation, they like
our office design.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.440
They need a job or they
think it&#39;s hot.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.130
We want people to be here
for

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.920
the one thing that will
never change, and

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.280
that&#39;s our mission.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.090
And just to tell you a quick
story about our mission.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.870
You know, Airbnb, you know,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.980
a lot of people describe it
as a way to book a room or

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.730
book a house when you travel
around the world.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.750
And that&#39;s what we do.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.880
But that&#39;s not at all why we
do it.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.680
And to answer the question
of, like, what,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.960
what our mission is, I&#39;ll
just tell you a quick story.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.090
And this, I think, describes
it.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.060
In early 2012, I met a host
named Sebastian.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.780
So we do these meet-ups
around the world where you

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.830
meet with hosts.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.210
And I meet this host named
Sebastian.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.660
He&#39;s probably, like, late
50s.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.450
He lives in north London.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.140
And Sebastian looks at me.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.970
He says, Brian.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.910
There&#39;s this word you never
use in your website.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.520
And I said, what&#39;s that
word?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.320
He said that word is
friendship.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.840
I would love to tell you the
story about friendship.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.980
I said, okay.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.990
Tell me the story about
friendship.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.140
He said six months ago,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.770
the run riots broke out in
front of my home and

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:25.340
I was very scared.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.810
And the next day my mom
called my to

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:27.770
make sure I was okay.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.670
He said yeah, mom.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:29.560
I&#39;m okay.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.840
He said, what about the
house?

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.400
And he says well yeah, the
house is okay as well.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.630
He said, here&#39;s the
interesting thing.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.710
Between the time the riots
broke out.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.130
And the time my mom called
me,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.480
was a 24 hour window of
time.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.830
And in that period of time
he said,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.990
seven of my previous Airbnb
guests called me.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.130
Just to make sure I was
okay.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.250
He said, think about that.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.430
Seven of my guests called me
before my own mother did.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.540
I don&#39;t know what that says
about our guests or

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.260
his mother more but-

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.150
&gt;&gt; But in this summer.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.870
On a typical night or

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.399
a peak night we would have
425,000 people,

00:21:04.399 --> 00:21:07.520
25,000 people staying in
homes and living together.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.390
And they were coming from
195 countries in the world.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:10.210
Which is every country but

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.220
North Korea, Iran, Syria and
Cuba.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.900
So when you hear that story,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.270
at our core what we&#39;re
about,

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.650
that&#39;s much more than just
booking a room or traveling.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.880
What we are about is we

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.820
wanna help bring the world
together.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.780
We wanna do that by giving a
sense of

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.240
belonging anywhere you go.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.530
So our mission is to belong
anywhere.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.420
So five years from now, 20
years from now, maybe we&#39;re

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.330
still selling rooms and
homes but maybe we&#39;re not.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.950
But I can guarantee you what
we&#39;re always gonna be about.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.880
It&#39;s a sense of belonging
and bringing people together

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.480
and that&#39;s the more enduring
idea.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.540
So when we hire people the
first thing we need to

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.410
make sure is if that&#39;s our
mission you need to

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.580
champion that mission.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.960
You champion the mission by
living the mission.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.580
Do you believe in it?

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.840
Do you have stories about
it?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.970
Have you used the product?

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.550
Would you bleed for the
product?

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.340
I used to ask like, crazy
questions like, one of the,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.930
the cra-crazy question Sam
reminds me of is I used to

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.120
interview people.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.180
So, I interview the first
300 employees at

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.060
Airbnb which people think
I&#39;m like neurotic and

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.330
that may also be true.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.000
But and I use to ask them a
question.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.030
Which I&#39;ve now amended.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.220
I use to ask them, if you
had a year left to live,

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.850
would you take this job?

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.187
And actually, the people who
say yes to that,

00:22:14.187 --> 00:22:14.983
you probably don&#39;t want.

00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:15.581
Cuz that&#39;s, like,

00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:16.910
they should spend time with
your family.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.700
&gt;&gt; So I amended it to ten
years.&#39;

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.480
Cuz I feel like you should,
you, whatever.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.230
If you knew you had ten
years left to live.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.540
Whatever you want, you would
do in those last ten years,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.950
you should just do.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.430
And, and I really wanted
people to think about that.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.960
That was enough time for,
like,

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.800
you to do something you
really cared about.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.630
And the answer doesn&#39;t have
to be this company.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:34.380
I say, fine.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.368
If the you&#39;re meant to do is
to travel, or

00:22:36.368 --> 00:22:37.783
if you&#39;re meant to do is
start a company,

00:22:37.783 --> 00:22:39.090
you should just do that.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:39.860
Don&#39;t come here.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.100
Go do that.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.120
And so there&#39;s this old kind
of parable probably many

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.070
of you heard of it.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.790
About like two men are
laying brick.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:47.620
Somebody comes up to

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:48.910
the first man says what are
you doing?

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.880
He says I&#39;m building a wall.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.410
He asks the other guy what
are you doing?

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.340
He says I&#39;m building a
cathedral.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.420
There&#39;s a job and then
there&#39;s a calling.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.180
And we want to

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.530
hire people that aren&#39;t just
looking for jobs.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:58.490
They&#39;re looking for a
calling.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.230
And that&#39;s, that&#39;s kinda the
first value and

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.080
that&#39;s to champion the
mission.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.880
I&#39;ll just, maybe,

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.630
cuz I don&#39;t want to just
take all the time up.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.880
I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll talk about,

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.380
I&#39;ll talk about just one
more, just so

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.160
we don&#39;t talk the whole
thing up just about values.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.640
The second value relates to
being kinda creative and

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.880
frugal, and I&#39;ll tell you a
story.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.140
Our company was like.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.700
By the way, all the founding
stories in your company end

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.640
up becoming the things that
people repeat and

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.470
talk about when you&#39;re a
1,000 people.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:22.593
And it kinda embodies,
right,

00:23:22.593 --> 00:23:23.720
its kinda like your
childhood.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.650
These things kinda come back
later in life.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.810
Same thing with a company.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.800
So Airbnb, I think Mark said
in the last talk that was

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.660
like the worst idea that
ever worked and.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.910
It, it, it really probably
was the worst idea, I mean,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.530
people thought we were
crazy.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.300
I remember telling people
about the idea.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.980
And I remember actually
telling Paul Graham,

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.910
we have this idea, in our
interview,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.520
we have this idea, it&#39;s
called Airbnb.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.060
He goes, people actually
doing this?

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.720
I go, yeah.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.400
His follow up question was,
what&#39;s wrong with them?

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.280
So I knew the interview
wasn&#39;t going well,

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.300
And in the, at the end of
the interview, Paul Graham,

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.320
I think, wasn&#39;t going to
accept us.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.660
And, but we told him the
story of

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.770
how we funded the company.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.270
And here&#39;s how it goes.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.870
We were introduced, Michael
Siebel,

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.000
who I believe he&#39;s a partner
of Y-Com.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.900
To let people know,
introduced me and

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.920
Joe to like 15 investors in
the Valley,

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.630
including some of the ones
that have been here.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.150
And all of them like said no
to the company.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.890
They could have bought 10%
of the company for

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.204
like 100, $150,000.

00:24:18.204 --> 00:24:19.288
They all said no.

00:24:19.288 --> 00:24:20.570
They thought it was a crazy
idea.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.820
No one would ever stay in
someone&#39;s home.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.900
So we ended up

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.010
just funding the company
with credit cards.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.390
And you know those binders
pe,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.400
kids use to put baseball
cards in?

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.570
So we put credit cards in
those.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.550
&gt;&gt; Cuz we had to put them
all somewhere.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.830
That&#39;s how many credit cards
we had.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.740
And we were completely in
debt.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.980
And in the fall of 2008 we
provided housing for

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.680
the Democratic and

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.040
Republican national
convention and.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.820
We had this weird crazy idea
cuz we

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.400
weren&#39;t really selling a lot
of homes.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.770
So basically Airbnb launched
and a year after we

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.430
launched I think we had a
hundred people a day

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.240
visiting our website and we
had like two bookings.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.082
Which is generally bad.

00:24:58.082 --> 00:24:59.570
It&#39;s kinda like releasing a
song and a year

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.200
later like three people
listen to it every day.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.490
Like it&#39;s probably not going
to be a very popular song.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.670
So, but I believed in it and
Joe and

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.140
Nate believed in it but And
so

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.060
we were completely in debt,
we don&#39;t know what to do.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.490
And so we get this idea well
we&#39;re air bed and breakfast,

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.260
we&#39;re providing housing for
the Democratic and

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.810
Republican national
conventions.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.670
What if we made like a
collectible breakfast cereal

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:22.040
for like the Democratic
national convention.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.540
And we came up with this
Obama,

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.930
Barack Obama theme cereal.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.550
We called it Obama-Os the
breakfast of change.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.180
And then we came up with a
Republican theme, so for

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.770
John McCain, we found out
he&#39;s a captain in the Navy,

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:35.530
so we came up with?

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.090
Captain McCain&#39;s.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.090
A maverick in every bite.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.960
And we had 0 dollars, and
without any money,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.660
we were able to, we tried to
call, like, General Mills.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.630
And they told us to, like,
stop calling them, or

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.730
they&#39;re getting restraining
orders, so that didn&#39;t work.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.880
But we found a local alumni
of RISD; he made 1,000 boxes

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.050
of cereal for us.

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.840
And we end up sending them
to press, and eventually,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.220
within a week, we got on
national television,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.370
national news.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.220
We made $40,000 selling
breakfast cereal.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.810
And that, the year 2008,

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.940
we made $5,000 from our
website, and

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.890
we made $40,000 selling the
breakfast cereal.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.560
And I remember my mom asking
me,

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.010
so are you a cereal company
now?

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.270
And that wasn&#39;t the bad
part.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.030
The bad part was the oddest
answer.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:23.860
Which was well, but the
reason I tell that,

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.799
is our second core value is
to be a serial entrepreneur.

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:30.576
I&#39;m sorry for the cheesy
pun.

00:26:30.576 --> 00:26:32.141
I&#39;m sorry.

00:26:32.141 --> 00:26:34.400
But be a serentrepreneur.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.370
And we really mean that we
believe constraints bring

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.110
out creativity.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.015
And when you raise like $800
million,

00:26:41.015 --> 00:26:43.280
suddenly all that
scrappiness.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.740
It&#39;s easy to lose that
scrappiness.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.070
It&#39;s easier for people to
tell you, you know,

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.950
I just need this like
$50,000 contract or

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.410
I need this or I need that.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.470
And whenever somebody
just,is just being a little

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.930
bit not, like frugal and not
being creative.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.490
Or they tell me they can&#39;t
do something,

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.570
I&#39;ll just take a box of
cereal.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.350
And, like,

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.100
even just a suggestion of
Obama knows they need to

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.440
be scrappy and frugal.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.980
And so again, a lot of the
founding DNA of your company

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.400
becomes these values, these
principles.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.420
And so, everyone knows,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.730
if you don&#39;t give a crap,
you shouldn&#39;t be here.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.330
And it doesn&#39;t mean you have
to give a crap.

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.380
It just means you have to,
to be here.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.030
And you also have to be
creative and

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.220
be like, kinda like an
entrepreneur.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:19.910
Super scrappy.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.020
And these are some of the
values we learn.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.750
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.440
So you guys should start,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.520
start thinking about
questions.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.760
I&#39;m gonna open up to
questions from the audience.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.180
But I have a few more
questions for you.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So,.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.060
This all sounds nice.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.950
The stories are great.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.520
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.150
&gt;&gt; People here are a pretty
skeptical group.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:35.870
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:36.960
a CS Department class.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.530
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Probably left

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.660
brain focused.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.587
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Feels like

00:27:39.587 --> 00:27:41.022
a softy kinda right brain
focus.

00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:42.052
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m a total softy.

00:27:42.052 --> 00:27:44.511
Sorry.

00:27:44.511 --> 00:27:49.461
&gt;&gt; But how has having your
strong culture helped you

00:27:49.461 --> 00:27:52.652
make important tough
decisions?

00:27:52.652 --> 00:27:55.438
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that having
a, so

00:27:55.438 --> 00:27:58.440
here&#39;s the thing about
culture.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.650
There&#39;s three things they
never tell you

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.700
about culture.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.130
The first thing is they
never tell you anything.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.440
In other words, no one ever
talks about culture, and

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.910
no one ever tells you you
need to have strong culture.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.230
And so, like there&#39;s tons of

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:09.790
articles about building a
great product.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.910
There&#39;s tons of articles
about

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.020
like growth and adoption.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.550
And there&#39;s very few things
about culture.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.720
It&#39;s this like mystical
thing that&#39;s like kinda

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.940
soft and fuzzy.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:17.990
That&#39;s the first problem.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:19.500
The second problem is it&#39;s
hard to measure.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.250
And things that get,

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.820
are hard to measure often
get discounted.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.040
And these are like two
really hard things.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.670
But the third thing is the
biggest problem.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:28.900
The biggest problem of
culture,

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.800
is it doesn&#39;t pay off in the
short-term.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.690
In fact, if you wanted to,
in one year,

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.970
build a company and sell it
as quickly as possible.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:36.860
The number one piece of
advice I give you is,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.640
fuck up the culture.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.310
Forget about it, just hire
people quickly.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.920
Culture makes you hire
really slowly and

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.820
makes you be deliberate
about decisions that in

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.800
the near term can slow
progress.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.101
It&#39;s kinda like putting an
investment into

00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:50.560
the company short-term.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.070
And so, these are the things
people never tell you.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.130
So it, it&#39;s really about
building a company for

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.590
the long-term and to endure.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.680
Now, some of the things
about culture.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.600
The first thing is you need
to

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.120
like be very clear about
like.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.490
What&#39;s unique to you, that
you stand for?

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:05.460
Once you do that, you need
to

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.650
make sure you hire people
that believe in that.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.360
And so we interviewed
hundreds of people.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.890
You need to make sure that
you hire and

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.690
fire based on the ideas of
these values.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.390
And, and, you know?

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:17.460
One of the things we do is
we

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.770
constantly repeat over and
over again.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:20.910
So we interview.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.190
Like, when we interview,

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:24.680
we wanna make sure they&#39;re
world class and

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.590
they fit the culture.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.380
So, the first thing I used
to ask people,

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.390
I had at the end of an
interview sheet.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.570
Is if you can hire.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:31.680
This is a functional
question.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.890
If you can hire anybody in
the world,

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.430
would you hire the person
sitting accords from you.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.190
And if our, our vision if
become like the best of

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.720
what we do why dont we hire
the very best in the world.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.750
So, every single person is
meant to

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.220
hire a person better than
the previous people.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.000
You&#39;re constantly hiring,
raising the bar.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.120
You&#39;re constantly hiring
world class people.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.500
Then we have separate people
called core value people.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.572
Who aren&#39;t in the function.

00:29:54.572 --> 00:29:56.900
So if you&#39;re an engineer,
the core values

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.495
engineers interviewers are
never engineers.

00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:01.298
Because we don&#39;t want them
to be biased and

00:30:01.298 --> 00:30:02.808
say, oh, I know how good
they are.

00:30:02.808 --> 00:30:04.528
And they interview just for
values,

00:30:04.528 --> 00:30:06.925
to make sure that people
care about the same thing.

00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:10.300
And we&#39;ve said no to a lot
of really great people.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.600
Because we just didn&#39;t feel
right about them being with

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.720
us long term.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.000
So that&#39;s one of the things.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.682
I also think that maybe some
other

00:30:20.682 --> 00:30:27.373
examples of when we kind of
had hard decisions.

00:30:27.373 --> 00:30:30.699
In mid 2011 we had this.

00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:32.778
So we were mostly in the
United States.

00:30:32.778 --> 00:30:35.634
And we had this internet
clone funded by these guys

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:37.340
called the Samwer brothers.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.890
Has anyone heard about the
Samwer brothers?

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.673
They basically, they clone.

00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:42.464
Yeah Rocket Internet, they
just went public.

00:30:42.464 --> 00:30:44.616
And they basically copy
American websites quickly,

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:46.370
and they try to sell it back
to you.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.140
And if you don&#39;t, then they
just try to,

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.540
so it&#39;s kind of like putting
a gun to your head.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.310
And so, and they had
basically done

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.320
this to Groupon.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.060
Groupon at this point was

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.700
like the fastest growing
company in the world ever.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.350
First company to,

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.580
fastest company to a billion
dollars in revenue.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.080
And then they stopped doing
Groupon.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.420
This is when Groupon was on
top of the world.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.730
And they cloned us.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.890
And we had 40 employees.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.070
We had raised $7 million.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.680
They cloned us, and they
raised $90 million.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.370
And, in 30 days, they hired
400 people.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.840
And they wanted to sell the
company and if they

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.510
couldn&#39;t, they were gonna
destroy us around the world.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.120
And the problem with

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.610
Airbnb is if we&#39;re not
everywhere around the world.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.530
Like, a travel site not
being in Europe is like

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:26.700
your phone not having email,
it doesn&#39;t actually work.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.805
So we were kind of in
trouble.

00:31:28.805 --> 00:31:32.180
And we had this conversation
and there was the pragmatic

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.910
decision of should we
acquire them and

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.010
then there was the values
decision.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.351
The pragmatic one should&#39;ve
probably have said buy

00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:40.756
them because you can&#39;t risk
losing international.

00:31:40.756 --> 00:31:43.013
So just guarantee you&#39;re
gonna get international.

00:31:43.013 --> 00:31:45.660
But we ended up not buying
them.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.460
And the reason we ended up
not buying them is I

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.590
just didn&#39;t like the
culture.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.910
I didn&#39;t wanna bring in this
400 people.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.080
I felt like we were
missionaries and

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.980
they were mercenaries.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.670
I didn&#39;t think they were
doing it for the beliefs.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.010
I thought they were doing it
to make a lot of

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.410
money very quickly.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.780
And I believe in a war on

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.910
missionaries would outlast
and out-endure mercenaries.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.960
And I also felt like the
best

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.770
revenge against an Internet
startup, Internet clone was

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.420
just to make them run the
company long term.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.869
It&#39;s like you have the baby,
now you gotta raise it.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.090
&gt;&gt; So.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:12.800
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s what we ended up
dong.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.860
And that was a very
controversial decision.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.030
A lot of people are telling
me,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.020
you should buy this company.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.660
We didn&#39;t.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.000
And I think it worked out.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.920
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s see, the last part
being how.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.340
What percentage of revenue
comes from Europe?

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.100
&gt;&gt; More than 50%.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.968
&gt;&gt; I think it worked out.

00:32:26.968 --> 00:32:28.121
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:32.170
&gt;&gt; All right, anybody have
any questions?

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.240
I can keep going.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.691
Yeah, so one other question,
one other statement we had

00:32:35.691 --> 00:32:37.200
at Zappos was that culture
and

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.080
brand were two sides of the
same coin.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.480
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.090
&gt;&gt; Airbnb has a great
culture and

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:42.810
also a great brand.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.660
You wanna talk a little bit
about branding, since that&#39;s

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.970
actually a kind of a weak
thing in Silicon Valley.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.190
We don&#39;t tend to focus on
this, on culture and brand.

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Yeah, that&#39;s what

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.630
I actually just said that to
Sam Altman.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:54.860
I think Silicon Valley is

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.870
not historically really
strong, or

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.970
we don&#39;t talk about culture
and brand very much.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.230
They are two sides of the
same coin.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.190
So cultural like the
principles and the beliefs

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.850
you have inside the company
that you want people to be

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:06.910
aligned with long term.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.520
And whatever happens inside

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.000
the company eventually comes
out.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.400
You can&#39;t hold it in.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.550
And brand is really the
promise outside the company

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:15.952
that everyone identifies
with.

00:33:15.952 --> 00:33:20.870
And so I think, having a
clear mission, and

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.360
making sure that you know
that mission, and

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.880
making sure that mission
comes through the company is

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.480
probably the most important
thing you can do for

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.360
both culture and values.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.970
And then, the second thing
you need to know is

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.060
that your brand, the way
people think about you

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.970
as a company, is often
decided by your, you know,

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.944
your brand evangelists are
your employees.

00:33:37.944 --> 00:33:40.160
And so you have a weak
culture.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.560
And we often think that
companies that hire

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.180
employees or people that are
deeply passionate,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.160
create companies that
customers are really,

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.040
really passionate about.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.350
And those are the companies
that have strong brands.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.448
And so, Zappos had a really
strong brand because they

00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:54.120
have strong culture.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:54.950
And a lot of companies,

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.676
Google, they care deeply
about the culture.

00:33:57.676 --> 00:33:58.520
They actually have a
question,

00:33:58.520 --> 00:33:59.810
is this person googly?

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:01.944
And it&#39;s meant to be like, a
catchall for

00:34:01.944 --> 00:34:03.950
do they fit the Google
culture.

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.200
Google&#39;s a very strong
culture.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.870
It&#39;s unique to Google.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.830
And, by the way, there&#39;s no
such thing as a good or

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.550
bad culture.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.980
It&#39;s either a strong or weak
culture.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.810
And a good culture for

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.020
somebody else may not be a
good culture for you.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.990
So, I think brand is

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:17.900
incredibly important as
well.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.380
And brand is really the
connection of you with your

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.110
customers.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.010
And so, if you have an
incredibly strong

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.930
culture that can be a whole
talk and brand.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.740
But if you have a fairly
strong culture,

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.170
then the brand will come
through.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.540
The final thing to say about
brand is,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.080
a lot of people when they
talk about their brand,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.490
they talk about what they
sell.

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.048
So if you&#39;re Apple, one way
of doing it is to say,

00:34:37.048 --> 00:34:37.992
we sell computers.

00:34:37.992 --> 00:34:42.070
And like, our new screens
are larger and it&#39;s faster.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.160
And they talk about bits and
bytes.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.970
And I remember Steve Jobs
had this really important

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.720
talk where he says the way
to win, this is 1997 when he

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.600
first came back, wasn&#39;t to
talk about bits and bytes.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.090
The way to win is to talk
about what we value.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.020
And our core value is we
believe people with

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.270
passion can change the
world.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.880
And that was how we

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.890
introduced the Think
Different campaign.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.190
And so Apple before they had
this huge renaissance, which

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.150
became the most valuable
company in the world.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.350
They did the Think Different
campaign,

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.350
which is basically saying,
this is what we believe in.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.140
And if you buy an Apple
computer,

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.370
you&#39;re also saying, I
believe in this, too.

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.605
And there would have to be,

00:35:12.605 --> 00:35:14.109
I think, a deeper core
belief and

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:16.216
if that doesn&#39;t happen,
you&#39;re a utility.

00:35:16.216 --> 00:35:18.239
And the utilities get sold
at commodity prices.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.870
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:25.471
&gt;&gt; How did you know how to
communicate this idea?

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.820
&gt;&gt; How?

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.840
The question is how do you
know how to communicate this

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.480
to the company?

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.630
The culture or the core
values.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.480
&gt;&gt; To the employees.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.660
To the outside world.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.710
&gt;&gt; The culture?

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.600
The values.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.400
The brand?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.210
&gt;&gt; How to communicate what
Airbnb does

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.430
&gt;&gt; Well, so

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:44.070
the question is how do

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.930
we communicate what Airbnb
does early in the days?

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.250
Well, we learned a lot
because in the early days,

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.950
we communicate like a
utility.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.080
We actually said Airbnb is a
cheap,

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.520
affordable alternative to
hotels.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.690
And we had a tagline of
forget hotels,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:58.970
save money with Airbnb.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.570
And over time we felt like
that was,

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.170
I mean this was in really
early days.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.660
And we felt like that was
way too limiting.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.102
That undercut the idea.

00:36:08.102 --> 00:36:12.400
And so, we then eventually
changed our tag line to

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.354
travel like a human.

00:36:13.354 --> 00:36:15.482
Which we haven&#39;t kept.

00:36:15.482 --> 00:36:19.095
But it was basically meant
to say that we believe in

00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:20.987
a certain kind of world and

00:36:20.987 --> 00:36:24.268
we really feel like travel
is mass produced.

00:36:24.268 --> 00:36:26.810
You feel isolated, you feel
like a stranger.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.569
And we want to bring the
world back to the place

00:36:28.569 --> 00:36:30.387
where it&#39;s a little bit like
a village again.

00:36:30.387 --> 00:36:32.661
Where the service is coming
from other people.

00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:34.159
You have this feeling like
you belong and

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:35.950
you&#39;re actually treated like
a human.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.750
You know, no matter how
successful you are in life,

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.070
often travelling will remind
you,

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.210
you&#39;re not that successful.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.690
Go through TSA, stay in a
typical hotel.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.510
Sometimes you&#39;ll have some
problems.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.300
And so we really want to
make people feel special.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.070
And this was kind of some of
the stuff we did in

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.080
the early days and we did a
lot of storytelling.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.270
I mean, I probably told the
story of

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.370
Airbnb like 10,000 times.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.910
And this is something that&#39;s
kind of related to culture.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.209
But one, somebody asked me

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:02.364
the other day like what&#39;s
the job of the CEO.

00:37:02.364 --> 00:37:04.172
And there&#39;s a number of
things a CEO does.

00:37:04.172 --> 00:37:07.392
But what you mostly do is
articulate the vision.

00:37:07.392 --> 00:37:08.610
So you articulate the
vision,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.620
you gotta develop a strategy
and

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.540
you gotta hire people to fit
the culture.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.870
If you do those three things
you

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.460
basically have a company.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.250
And that company will
hopefully be successful.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.060
If you have the right
vision,

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.410
the right strategy and good
people.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.890
So what we end up doing is

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.270
articulating the vision over
and over and over again.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.470
Whether you&#39;re hiring people
or

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:25.670
recruiting them, talking to
investors to raise money,

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.360
doing PR interviews, if
you&#39;re speaking at a class.

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.980
You&#39;re always reinforcing
the values.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.440
You&#39;re doing it in email to
a customer.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.060
And so you just do it
thousands of times.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:35.110
And if you do something
thousands of

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.840
times it will change and get
better every time.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.880
So it&#39;s just kind of,
evolved.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, question.
&gt;&gt; So

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.510
you are interacting with the
host,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.890
somehow you&#39;re in charge of
the host and

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:46.920
reinforcing the parts of
Airbnb?

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.050
&gt;&gt; Very, very good question.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.950
How do we make sure

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:53.245
the hosts are reinforcing
the culture of Airbnb?

00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:57.770
So when, the answer to that
is, we do a pretty good

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:59.960
job but not yet an amazing
job at it.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.720
When we first started
Airbnb,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.780
I kinda took the Craig
Newmark school of thought.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.050
Craig Newmark&#39;s the founder
of Craigslist.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.450
And I said, anybody should
be able to use Airbnb.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.190
You didn&#39;t have to apply.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.180
If you wanted to rent your
place,

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.620
you could rent your place.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.060
And it turned out that many
of

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.604
the people believed in our
values because we

00:38:17.604 --> 00:38:19.070
talked about it and we
tracked them.

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:20.570
But there were people who
rented on Airbnb not

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.609
because they believed in
values, but because they

00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:24.666
realized they can make a lot
of money renting their home.

00:38:24.666 --> 00:38:27.510
And not everyone really was
a great culture fit.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.112
And these people actually
did cause us a lot of

00:38:30.112 --> 00:38:30.803
problems.

00:38:30.803 --> 00:38:32.945
So, that was actually a bit
of a lesson for me.

00:38:32.945 --> 00:38:34.985
And I didn&#39;t think our host
had to,

00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:37.710
it didn&#39;t really occur to me
in the early days.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.900
The host had to completely
fit the values,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.270
that we met them, we attract
people like us.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.880
And so, over time, we&#39;ve
realized host or partners,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.312
and so they need to believe
in the same values we do.

00:38:48.312 --> 00:38:52.190
And so now we have a program
called the Superhost

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.030
program where they have to
demonstrate values to

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.380
reach this kind of badge,
which gets them kind

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.210
of priority customer support
and distribution.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.900
We are having this host
convention where you

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:03.670
bring all the hosts in.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.350
We&#39;re gonna be talking about
and reinforcing the values.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.800
We&#39;re moving towards the
place where they have to

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.090
apply to list.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:12.190
And we don&#39;t test them the
way we test an employee but

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.680
we&#39;re starting to get more
rigorous about it.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.010
So the answer is, the answer
is we were really late but

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.890
we now do it by gradually
moving towards apply to list

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.975
and reinforcing it every
step of the way.

00:39:23.975 --> 00:39:25.470
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:28.440
&gt;&gt; When Airbnb has made some
great contributions to

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.130
the open source community.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.130
Do you have any thoughts on
how that contributes to

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.170
the culture of your
development team?

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.204
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:36.204 --> 00:39:38.760
I think, just in general,
and

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.110
it may be related to two
things about Airbnb.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:47.300
We tend to be a pretty open
culture, just in general.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.068
We communicate a lot.

00:39:48.068 --> 00:39:51.050
And we generally believe in
the idea of like,

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.270
a shared world where people
are giving back and

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.540
contributing, making
communities and

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.880
industries stronger.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.768
So, just my one philosophy
on communication is,

00:39:59.768 --> 00:40:01.489
we basically communicate and

00:40:01.489 --> 00:40:04.518
talk about everything
internally except for things

00:40:04.518 --> 00:40:07.224
that relate to employee or
customer privacy.

00:40:07.224 --> 00:40:09.173
So, if it doesn&#39;t relate to
those two things,

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:10.553
we&#39;ll basically talk about
it.

00:40:10.553 --> 00:40:12.524
As far as open source
culture and

00:40:12.524 --> 00:40:15.225
engineering, we wanted to
make sure that we

00:40:15.225 --> 00:40:18.221
had a really strong
identification of the team.

00:40:18.221 --> 00:40:21.744
And so we really felt like a
lot of source codes

00:40:21.744 --> 00:40:23.043
shouldn&#39;t be,

00:40:23.043 --> 00:40:27.050
you know, we felt like every
company needs a moat.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:27.590
Some kind of

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.760
moat that protects you from
your competition.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.620
We thought some technology
would be, but

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.030
we also felt like we wanted
to be

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.080
able to get back from a
technology standpoint.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.767
And we preferred our moat to
be that we provide the very

00:40:38.767 --> 00:40:41.288
best experience in the world
when you use Airbnb.

00:40:41.288 --> 00:40:43.117
We have the biggest network
effects.

00:40:43.117 --> 00:40:46.627
And we thought that kind of
took precedent over

00:40:46.627 --> 00:40:50.503
having certain technology
that only we could use.

00:40:50.503 --> 00:40:52.345
And so we decided to try to
share some of

00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:53.330
that out to people.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:56.600
And I think, again, it does
relate to the values.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.100
Now one other thing is I
never one day recommended.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.320
Hopefully, if you have a
strong culture,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.490
I didn&#39;t recommend we do any
of that.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.690
We hired engineers that we
felt like fit the values.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.880
And it just independently
occurred to

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.770
them they should do that.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.130
They felt like that was the
right thing to do.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.310
&gt;&gt; All the way in the back.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.300
&gt;&gt; You talked about how
during the conventions you

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.640
didn&#39;t have any money and

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.090
only a couple people visited
your site.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.090
What did you do to increase
the number of

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.250
users that came to your
site?

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.280
How did you scale that out?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.020
&gt;&gt; So the question was,
Brian had talked about

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.790
that there weren&#39;t that many
visitors to the site

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.410
when they were trying to
sort of get off the ground.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.095
How did they get users to
the site?

00:41:33.095 --> 00:41:37.230
&gt;&gt; So this is actually not
about culture but

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.050
I will answer it anyway.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.235
So, you know a lot of
people,

00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:45.460
this is not even a culture
question, but the best

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.530
advice I ever got was
probably from Paul Graham.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.520
And Paul Graham basically
said,

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.220
I remember he had this line.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.330
He said it&#39;s better, he may
have even talked about this

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.241
at a talk, he said it&#39;s
better to have 100 people

00:41:58.241 --> 00:42:01.087
that love you than to have a
million people that just

00:42:01.087 --> 00:42:03.280
kinda sorta like you.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.710
It&#39;s literally better to
have 100 people love you.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:07.244
And the reason why, if you
have a million costumers or

00:42:07.244 --> 00:42:08.146
a million users and

00:42:08.146 --> 00:42:10.061
they just kinda don&#39;t care
about you but

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:12.900
they kinda use your app and
you&#39;re okay.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.600
To get them to care is a
really, really hard thing.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.160
In fact, I don&#39;t know how to
get a million people to

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.450
all of a sudden care.

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.260
What I do know is if you get
100 people that love you,

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.210
those people if they feel
incredibly passionate,

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.950
each of them will tell 100
people.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:28.970
And in fact all movements
typically start, or

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.850
companies or ideas that are
really powerful,

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.100
start with just 100 people.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.980
So the reason this is so

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.290
critical is he gave us
another lesson.

00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.490
Which is if all you need to
do

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.140
is get 100 people to love
you.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.528
Then what you need to do is
things that don&#39;t scale.

00:42:41.528 --> 00:42:44.800
So it&#39;s hard if you have a
million people you

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.710
can&#39;t meet all of them.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.290
But you can meet 100 people.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.880
You can spend time with
them.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.510
So that&#39;s exactly what we
did.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.630
Joanie and I,

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.940
we would go door to door in
New York City or in Denver

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.390
where the Democratic
National Convention was.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:58.260
Literally meeting with,
staying with and

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.050
living with our users.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.360
I use to joke that when you
buy an iPhone Steve Jobs

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.930
didn&#39;t come and sleep on
your couch but I did.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.600
And that, that was really
critical,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.930
living with your users.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:11.670
And by living with our users
and spending time with them,

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:14.290
all we had to do is give
them enough time, attention.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:14.977
And get them to get to

00:43:14.977 --> 00:43:17.210
the point where they were
deeply passionate.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.560
And if you work backwards
from 100 people or

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:20.970
even one person.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.310
Without even technology,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.720
imagine what would be an
amazing experience for

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.210
just this one person.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.710
And walk through the journey
from the time they,

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.150
whatever your service is,
right?

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.500
And make it perfect for that
one person.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.690
Once you make a service
perfect for

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.710
one person, it&#39;s actually
really easy to

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.410
make almost anything perfect
for a person.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:38.880
It&#39;s not actually that hard.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.360
The hard thing is then how
do we scale this to

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.540
millions of people.

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.840
Where everyone gets in
trouble is they try to

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.060
solve both at the same time.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.060
So, the first thing we

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.868
do is get the perfect
experience for one person.

00:43:47.868 --> 00:43:49.240
We went door-to-door to do
this,

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.340
we won over their love.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.460
Then we use a separate part
of our brain to imagine,

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.410
now how would we achieve
that at scale?

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:56.310
And I&#39;ll give you one
example before I

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.150
stop talking about this.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.820
Right now on Airbnb you can,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.860
if you put your home on
Airbnb,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.950
you can click a button and
it kinda works like UBER.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:04.900
And we did this before UBER,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.420
a professional photographer
comes to your house and

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.970
they&#39;ll photograph your
homes for free.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:11.830
We have 5000 photographers
around the world, and

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.690
we photographed hundreds of
thousands of homes.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.620
So it&#39;s probably one of the
largest on-demand

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.710
photography networks, if
there was such a thing,

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.650
I guess probably the only
one in the world.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.890
And that started with Joe
and I.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.490
We were living, we were
staying not living,

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.040
staying with this one host
in New York City.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.730
And her house is amazing,
but

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.620
her photos were terrible.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.350
And we said, why don&#39;t you
just put up better photos?

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:34.770
And this is before, you
know,

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.370
iPhones had great cameras,
this was 2008.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.250
And she said, well,

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:39.940
I can&#39;t figure out how to
get photos from this camera,

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.190
onto this computer.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.500
She wasn&#39;t very technically
savvy.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.220
And we just said well, we&#39;ll
just take photos for you.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:49.060
Or actually I said, what if
you can press a button and

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.460
somebody just showed up at
your door and

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.810
took professional
photographs.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.829
She said, that would be
magic.

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:56.871
So next day, I knocked on
her door and said I&#39;m here.

00:44:56.871 --> 00:44:59.787
And I photographed her home.

00:44:59.787 --> 00:45:01.647
And then we sent emails to
people saying,

00:45:01.647 --> 00:45:03.783
we have this new magical
photography service.

00:45:03.783 --> 00:45:05.429
And if you want you can
press this button and

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:07.594
a professional photographer
will show up at your home.

00:45:07.594 --> 00:45:08.902
Somewhere just press this
button and

00:45:08.902 --> 00:45:10.214
just send me an alert or Joe
an alert.

00:45:10.214 --> 00:45:11.711
And we&#39;d rent a camera in
Brooklyn.

00:45:11.711 --> 00:45:14.030
In January of 2009 walking
through snow,

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:16.160
photographing people&#39;s
homes.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.210
We did this by hand without
any technology.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.240
We managed it with just
spreadsheets.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.894
I wasn&#39;t gonna burden Nate
with trying to

00:45:21.894 --> 00:45:24.600
build something we designed
before we had photography.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.210
Then we started hiring
contract photographers.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:27.820
Then eventually we

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.370
got a intern to manage all
the contract photographers.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.990
Then we got a intern to
become

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.860
a full-time employee
managing other interns to

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.380
manage the contract
employees.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.320
&gt;&gt; And at some point, this
is before we built anything.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.490
And at some point there were
too many,

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.520
like people to manage.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.440
Like, there were like
hundreds of photographers.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.610
And then we finally built
all of

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.600
the tools to manage all the
photography.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.928
But we did it only after we
knew exactly what

00:45:49.928 --> 00:45:51.969
the perfect service was.

00:45:51.969 --> 00:45:52.711
&gt;&gt; How about one more
question?

00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:54.298
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:45:54.298 --> 00:45:56.513
&gt;&gt; So a lot of people say
that when,

00:45:56.513 --> 00:45:59.309
when the hardest part isn&#39;t
the technology.

00:45:59.309 --> 00:46:00.410
Here the marketing,

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.340
the communication is the
hardest part there would be.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.940
And a lot of people say it&#39;s
not

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:09.480
the technology
&gt;&gt; So

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.760
do you wanna repeat the
question?

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:15.420
&gt;&gt; So the question is a lot
of peop in this particular

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.830
situation with Airbnb, a lot
of people think that this is

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.610
not necessarily a technology
company, but

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:20.940
it&#39;s more of a marketing
company.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:22.750
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.686
So I&#39;ll, well, I&#39;ll tell
you,

00:46:24.686 --> 00:46:26.700
I&#39;ll answer the question
with a story.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.402
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me, let me, let
me, let me just,

00:46:30.402 --> 00:46:32.940
let me preface that question
by a set of questions.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.620
Do you have, do you today
have proprietary technology?

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.440
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.040
&gt;&gt; Do you have a moat?

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:40.660
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.551
&gt;&gt; Do you have network
effects?

00:46:41.551 --> 00:46:42.453
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:42.453 --> 00:46:43.870
&gt;&gt; Do you have pricing
power?

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.522
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:45.522 --> 00:46:47.070
&gt;&gt; Do you have a good brand?

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.087
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:46:49.696 --> 00:46:52.504
&gt;&gt; Are are you a monopoly?

00:46:52.504 --> 00:46:54.390
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not gonna answer
that.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.620
&gt;&gt; But, but I think similar
to the question

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.040
just forgetting about all of
that.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.840
It, companies that have
network affects and

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.790
sort of get off the ground
based on.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The fly wheel is going.

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.500
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; People just think that

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.190
you&#39;re lucky.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:10.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me, let me.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.540
It&#39;s a totally fair
question.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:12.310
And people have said it.

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.720
So, I wanna answer it.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.543
You guy that runs the
Sequoia Capital now,

00:47:16.543 --> 00:47:17.960
his name is Doug Leoni.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.780
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.300
&gt;&gt; One day, I think it was a
year, year and

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.200
a half ago, Doug Leoni says,
your job sucks.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.780
&gt;&gt; And I was like, what the
hell does that mean?

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:25.460
Like this is like,

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.700
you&#39;ve got the worst job of
an CEO in my portfolio.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.720
And I said, tell me why.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:30.920
And this is what he said.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.310
He says, well, let me,
here&#39;s how I think about it.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.220
First of all, you&#39;re a
technology company.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.500
And he thought we were a
technology company and

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.760
I would say, at our heart,

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.470
in many ways we are a
technology company.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.280
And so, we have all the
challenges of all my

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.720
other portfolio companies.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.750
But beyond that, you are in
190 countries.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:50.510
And so, you have to figure
out how to be international.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:51.980
We have to hire people in

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.900
countries all over the
world.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.450
We&#39;re literally in every
country but

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:56.180
North Korea, Rio, Syria, and
Cuba.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.230
You&#39;re a, basically a
payments company.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.259
We handle billions of

00:47:59.259 --> 00:48:01.270
dollars through our system
every year.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.880
And we had to get

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.200
money transmitter licenses
in the state of California.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.230
So we actually are a
payments company, and

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.110
we have serious fraud and
risk to, to, to warrant, and

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.350
needs to be locked down like
Fort Knox.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.760
He said, that&#39;s, that&#39;s
usually where companies end.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.400
But you&#39;ve gotta worry about
all the other crap.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.244
And he says, trust in
safety.

00:48:17.244 --> 00:48:19.671
You know we have 425,000
people staying in

00:48:19.671 --> 00:48:22.271
other people&#39;s, under, in
other people&#39;s beds,

00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:23.719
in their sheets.

00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:26.206
&gt;&gt; Think about a woman from
Texas staying in

00:48:26.206 --> 00:48:28.111
the Middle East or vice
versa.

00:48:28.111 --> 00:48:30.448
The cultural conflicts that
could happen and

00:48:30.448 --> 00:48:31.802
misunderstandings and,

00:48:31.802 --> 00:48:34.760
you know, you have 425,000
people a night.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.632
It&#39;s like being the mayor of
Oakland.

00:48:36.632 --> 00:48:38.298
Now, imagine if you&#39;re the
mayor of Oakland,

00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:40.510
all these things happen in
Oakland tonight.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.368
&gt;&gt; So you&#39;ve got trust in
safety.

00:48:42.368 --> 00:48:44.290
Now, we have regulatory
problems.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:46.850
You know, we are in 34,000
cities.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:49.330
Every city has a different
law, different rules.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.720
And many of them were
written in a different

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.765
century, before you had any
of this technology.

00:48:52.765 --> 00:48:54.790
So you&#39;ve got to deal with
that.

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:57.380
Then you&#39;ve got issues like
search and discovery.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.200
So, Google&#39;s got this brand
about being really

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.170
important about search.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.980
The thing about search,

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.710
though, is usually if I have
a question, if Google can

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.420
give me 40,000 results, but
it&#39;s probably clear that

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.960
there&#39;s like one or two best
options for everybody.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.320
So if I wanna know a
question to an answer,

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.570
these are usually my best
answer.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:15.990
We have 40,000 homes in
Paris.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.530
There is no best home in
Paris for

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:18.790
anybody in this room.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.000
So we have to be really,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.320
really great at matching
people and technology.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.480
We have to be a company
that&#39;s just, you know,

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.380
another example.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.640
Facebook, for example, is a
digital product.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.570
Their product is their
website.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.420
Our product are these
experiences you

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.850
have in the real world.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.070
So, we&#39;re not just an online
product.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.300
We have to be an offline
product.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.720
And we need to transition
from when you&#39;re in

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.950
your app, through cities.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.010
And these are just some of
the examples why technology,

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.980
design.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.250
So basically, the long and

00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.450
short of it is we have to be
world class at technology.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.130
We have to be world class at
design.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:52.070
We have to be world class at
branding, because we&#39;ve got

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.760
to convince people this
isn&#39;t crazy.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.360
You&#39;re not gonna die when
you use it.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.450
We had to convince
governments,

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.600
this is good for
neighborhood.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.670
What happens if the internet
moves into

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.200
your neighborhood?

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.600
That&#39;s what people call it.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.090
It&#39;s a good thing,
hopefully.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.930
And you&#39;ve got to make sure
trust in safety is really

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.940
world class, that we handle
all these payments and

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.630
not have problems with risk.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.850
And I can kind of go
through, and

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.410
this is not even to do with
culture.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.130
I didn&#39;t even mention
culture.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.590
So, that&#39;s how I describe it
is like,

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.550
I think great companies are
companies that are probably

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.950
really strong at everything.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:18.211
But you know, we have,

00:50:18.211 --> 00:50:19.999
we try to hire the very best
engineers and

00:50:19.999 --> 00:50:21.473
technical talent in the
world and

00:50:21.473 --> 00:50:23.754
I definitely don&#39;t see us as
a marketing company.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:24.509
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:50:24.509 --> 00:50:25.318
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, guys.

00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:32.753
&gt;&gt; All right, thank you sir.

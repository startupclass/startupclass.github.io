WEBVTT

00:00:04.773 --> 00:00:06.318
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:10.993
So today I am going to be
talking about how to go

00:00:10.993 --> 00:00:14.740
from zero users to many
users.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.760
I&#39;m just assuming that you
have many great ideas in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.376
your head at this moment and

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:22.550
you&#39;re kind of thinking
about what the next step is.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.620
So I wrote this up early
this morning,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.880
and a lot of this is based
off of mistakes I&#39;ve

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.170
made in the past.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
So as Sam mentioned, I went
through YC in 2010 and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.740
spent a number, three years
basically, going back and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.290
forth pivoting a bunch of
times,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200
starting over a bunch of
times.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.560
And have learned a lot about
what not to do if I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.340
were to start another
startup after Homejoy if

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.690
that should ever happen.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.994
And so a lot of it comes
from failure and

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:56.379
just telling you about what
you shouldn&#39;t do and kind of

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.117
making generalizations of
what you should do

00:00:59.117 --> 00:00:59.852
from that.

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.788
So just a reminder that this
is,

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:04.728
sort of, you know, all
advice you should take as

00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:07.456
directionally good guidance,
like if all,

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.569
like it&#39;s, it&#39;s kind of in
the right direction.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.541
But every business is
different,

00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.853
you are different, I&#39;m not
you, and so

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:17.920
just take everything with,
you know, that in mind.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.060
So since this is a college
course, you know,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.670
when you start a startup you
should basically have lots

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.120
of time on your hands to
concentrate on the start up.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.639
And I&#39;m not saying you
should you know,

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.031
quit school or you should
quit work.

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:35.485
What I&#39;m saying is you
should have a lot of time,

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:37.346
compressed time in a row.

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:39.258
Really dedicated to
immersing yourself in

00:01:39.258 --> 00:01:41.487
the idea and developing
problems, or developing

00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:44.860
the solutions to the problem
you&#39;re trying to solve.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.910
So for example if you&#39;re in
school, you know,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.980
it&#39;s better to have one or

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.520
two days straight of per
week on working on your idea

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.640
versus you know, spending
two hours here and there

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.250
every single day during the
course of the week.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.410
It&#39;s sort of like, I think
this is an engineering class

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.269
so it&#39;s sort of like coding.

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:04.050
Like there&#39;s a lot of
context switching and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.920
just being able to really
focus, really, really focus

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.390
and immerse yourself is very
very important.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.460
So, like I said, I sort of
first,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.720
when I wrote this up was
thinking what

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.520
are things that some people
do or most people do that is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.070
not the correct way to do a
startup and sort of

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.560
the novice approach I think
is what you see up here.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.630
Which is, you know, I have
this really great idea.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.500
I don&#39;t wanna tell anyone
about it.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.986
I&#39;m gonna build, build,
build, build.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:37.470
I&#39;m gonna be telling one or

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100
two people and then I&#39;m
gonna launch it on,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.710
you know, I&#39;m gonna launch
it on TechCrunch or some,

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.760
somewhere like that, then
I&#39;m gonna get lots of users.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.520
But what really happens is
because you did not

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.640
get a lot of that feedback
and stuff like that,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.260
you know maybe you get a lot
of people to your site,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.560
but no one sticks around
because you didn&#39;t get

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.110
that initial user feedback.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.230
And then, you know, if you,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.670
you know, if lucky enough
you have some money in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.490
the bank you might go buy
some users but sort of,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.780
it just whittles out over
time and you just give up.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.503
This is sort of a vicious
cycle and

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:09.596
you know, I actually did
this once, and

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.011
I did this while I was in
YC,

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:13.595
and that was you know like,
when I went through YC I

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.257
didn&#39;t even launch a
product,

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:18.150
like I didn&#39;t even launch in
TechCrunch which is a thing

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.600
you should definitely do.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.950
And so you don&#39;t want to
ever get into that

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.780
cycle because you&#39;ll just
end up with nothing good.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.120
So, the next thing is you
know, you have an idea and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.080
you should really think
about what the idea

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.060
is really solving.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.720
Like what is the actual
problem?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.480
And so their problem
statements you should be

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.480
able to describe it in one
sentence.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.610
And then you should think,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.200
how does that problem relate
to me?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.420
Am I really passionate about
that problem?

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.720
And then you should think,
okay, it&#39;s a problem I have,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.420
is it a problem that other
people have?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.805
And sort of verify that by,
you know, just going out and

00:03:56.805 --> 00:03:58.040
talking to people.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.674
One of the biggest mistakes
I&#39;ve made is you know,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:04.210
we started, my co-founder
and I,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.322
who is also my brother, he
and

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:10.653
I started a company called
Pathjoy in 2009, 2010.

00:04:10.653 --> 00:04:13.360
And our goal was basically
to you know,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.971
we had two goals in mind one
is to create a company that

00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:20.584
made people really happy,
and create a company that

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:23.784
was very, very impactful, so
a good proxy for

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:26.847
that is to just create a
huge, big company.

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:28.589
And so we thought, okay,

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:32.075
here&#39;s sort of what we&#39;re
gonna solve is you know,

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:35.720
make people happier, and we
first went to the notion of

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.590
who are the people that made
people happy?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.438
And you know,

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:42.500
we came up with life coaches
and therapists.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.790
So it seemed kind of obvious
to

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.920
just create a platform for
life coaches and therapists.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.380
And what happened as a
result though was that you

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.180
know, when we started using
the product ourselves we,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.560
you know, we&#39;re not cynical
people by any means,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.450
but life coaches and
therapists are just not

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.890
people we would use
ourselves.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.790
It was sort of useless to
us.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.470
And so, it wasn&#39;t even a
problem we had, and

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.420
certainly wasn&#39;t something
we

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.360
were super passionate about
building out.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.400
Yet we spent, you know,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.470
almost a year trying to do
this.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.670
And so, if you just start,
you know,

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.470
from tegel zero, just like
think about this before you

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.760
even build any product.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.300
I think you can save
yourself a lot of

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.210
headache down the road

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.167
from doing something you
don&#39;t wanna do.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.510
So, say you have a problem
and you&#39;re able to state it.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.520
Where do you start?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.609
Like, how do you think of
solutions?

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.957
So the first thing you
should do is think of

00:05:35.957 --> 00:05:40.920
what the industry that you
are getting yourself into.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.070
Whether it&#39;s big, whether
it&#39;s huge,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.470
you should really immerse
yourself in that industry.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.710
There&#39;s a number of ways to
do this.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.790
One is, you know, to really
become a cog in

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.910
that industry for a little
bit.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.000
And so it might seem a
little counter-intuitive to

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.270
do this, because most people
say, you know,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.330
if you really wanna disrupt
an industry, you

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
should really not be this,
you know, player in it.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.280
You should, you know,
someone who spent 20 or

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.770
30 years in an industry
probably you know, is set in

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.990
their ways and is just used
to the way things work and

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.090
really can&#39;t think about
what the inefficiencies are

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.220
or the things that you can,
quote, unquote, disrupt.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.060
But, however as a noob like
coming into the industry,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.350
you really should take one
or

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.170
two months just really
understanding what all

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.880
the little bits and pieces
of the industry are, and how

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.790
it works because it&#39;s when
you get into the details,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.270
that&#39;s when you start seeing
things you can exploit.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.710
Things you can really,
things that are really,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.450
really inefficient and
provide you know huge

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.590
overhead costs that you can
cut down.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.740
And, so an example of this
is, you know,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.560
when we start Homejoy and
we, we decided to go,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.670
we started with the cleaning
industry and when we

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.180
started, you know, we just
were cleaners ourselves.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.800
And we started to clean
houses and

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.970
we found out really quickly
was that

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.450
we were very bad cleaners.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.380
And so as a result, you
know, we said, okay, we

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.298
got to learn more about this
and we went to buy books.

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:12.790
And we bought books about
how to clean,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.320
which helped maybe a little
bit,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.180
we learned a little bit more
about cleaning supplies.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.520
But it&#39;s sort of like
basketball you know,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.220
you can watch and you can
learn,

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.740
or you can watch and you can
read about basketball, but

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.830
you&#39;re not gonna get any
better at

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.510
it if you don&#39;t actually you
know, train and you know,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.826
throw a basketball around
and throw it into the hoop.

00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:35.740
And so we decided one of us
basically had to go and

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.570
learn how to clean.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.395
And so we went or

00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:40.314
get trained by you know, a
professional, some sort of

00:07:40.314 --> 00:07:43.578
a professional training
programs that existed.

00:07:43.578 --> 00:07:46.230
And that meant, we actually
went to get a job at

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.319
a cleaning company itself.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.680
And the cool thing was that
you know, I learned how to

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.460
clean from you know,
training for the few weeks

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.690
that I was there at the
cleaning company.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.113
But the even better thing
was that I learned a lot

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:04.289
about how a local cleaning
company worked.

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:07.489
And in that sense you know,
I learned why a local

00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:11.170
cleaning company could not
become huge like Homejoy is

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.450
today and that&#39;s because
they have, you know,

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.531
they&#39;re pretty old school
and

00:08:16.531 --> 00:08:19.892
they have a lot of things,
just from anywhere from

00:08:19.892 --> 00:08:23.094
booking the customer to
optimizing the cleaner

00:08:23.094 --> 00:08:26.245
schedules was just done very
inefficiently.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:30.737
And so there is, so, if you
are in a situation like mine

00:08:30.737 --> 00:08:34.937
where you know, there&#39;s a
service element to it,

00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:38.900
you should go and do that
service yourself.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.510
You know, if your thing is
related to restaurants you

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.640
should become a waiter it&#39;s
really to you know,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.790
if it&#39;s painting you know
become a painter kind of

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.960
get in the shoes of your
customers from all angles of

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.850
what you&#39;re trying to build.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.910
The other thing is there&#39;s
also levels of obsessiveness

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.340
that you should have with it
too as well.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.900
You should be so obsessed to
know what everybody in

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.190
the space is doing.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.290
And it&#39;s things like, you
know,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.660
running a list of all the
potential competitors or

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.990
similar types of companies,
Google searching it, and

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.290
clicking on every single
link and

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.860
reading every single article
from like,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.660
search result 1 to 1,000.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.950
You know, I found all
potential competitors,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.590
big and small, and

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.610
if they&#39;re public, I would
go read their S1&#39;s,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.570
I would go read all their
quarterly financials,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.000
I would, you know, sit on
the earnings calls.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.730
There&#39;s, you know, most of
these you don&#39;t get much out

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.390
of it, but there&#39;s just
these golden nuggets that

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.440
you&#39;ll find once in a while
and you can&#39;t,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.600
you won&#39;t be able to find
that unless you

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.290
actually go through the work
of,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.870
you know, getting all that
information in your head.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.000
So yeah, you should become
an expert in the industry.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.120
There should be no doubt
when you&#39;re building this

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.550
that you are the expert so
that people will trust you

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.680
when you&#39;re building this
product.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.500
The second thing is

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.340
identifying customer
segments.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.610
So you know, ideally at the
end of the day,

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.670
in the end game, you built a
product or

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.434
a business that everybody in
the world is using.

00:10:05.434 --> 00:10:07.910
But realistically in the
beginning you kind of

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.160
want to corner off a certain
part of the customer base so

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.321
that you can really optimize
for them, and that&#39;s just

00:10:14.321 --> 00:10:16.860
you know, it&#39;s just about a
matter of focus and a matter

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.860
of you know, just catering
towards whether it&#39;s

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.205
teenage girls or whether
it&#39;s you know, soccer moms.

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:27.150
You would just be able to
you know,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.609
like I said focus a lot on
their needs.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.640
And, lastly before before
you even create the product,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.230
before you put code down,
you should really storyboard

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.490
out the ideal user
experience of how you&#39;re,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.800
how you&#39;re gonna solve the
problem.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.820
And that, and that&#39;s not
just meaning, you know,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.310
the web site itself, it&#39;s
meaning, you know,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.210
how does the customer find
out about you.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.910
You know, whether it&#39;s, you
know,

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.620
it could be through an ad or
through word of mouth or

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.590
whatever, so they find out
about you.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.760
They come to your site, they
learn more about you, what&#39;s

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.670
all that text say, what are
you communicating to them.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.340
So the actual, when they
sign up for the product or

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.790
they purchase the service,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.430
what are they actually
getting,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.420
to after they finish using
the product or

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.800
after they finish using the
service.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.100
What&#39;s you know, there&#39;s
sort of

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.525
like an evaluation period,
like they leave a review, or

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:21.660
they leave comments or
whatnot, and just being able

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.720
to go through that whole
flow and visualize in your

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.628
head, like just envision
what the perfect user

00:11:29.628 --> 00:11:32.370
experience is and then put
it down on paper and

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.008
then put it into code, and
then start from there.

00:11:35.008 --> 00:11:40.530
So you have all these ideas
in your head now,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.320
you kind of know what the
core customer base you

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.210
want to go after is.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.354
And you know like everything
about the industry,

00:11:47.354 --> 00:11:48.810
what do you do next?

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.650
So you start building your
products.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.160
And you know, the common
phrase that most people

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.652
use these days is you should
build a minimum viable,

00:11:56.652 --> 00:11:58.250
the MVP, minimum viable
product.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.500
And I know I&#39;m viable
because I

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.950
think a lot of people skip
that part,

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.200
and they just go out with a
feature and then the whole

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.121
user experience in the very
beginning like is flat.

00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:13.190
So the minimum viable
product pretty much

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.189
means you know,

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:18.340
what is the smallest feature
set that you should build

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.370
to solve the problem that
you&#39;re trying to solve.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.818
And I think if you go
through the whole storyboard

00:12:24.818 --> 00:12:27.549
experience, you can kind of
figure that very quickly.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.050
But again you have to be
talking to users right,

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.724
potential users, you have to
be

00:12:32.724 --> 00:12:35.266
seeing what exists out there
already and what you

00:12:35.266 --> 00:12:38.025
should be building to solve
their immediate needs.

00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:42.305
And the second thing is,
before you put

00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:45.260
in things in front of a user
you should really have your

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.790
simple product positioning
down.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.400
And what I mean by that is
that you know,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.080
you should be able to go to
you know a person, and

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.490
you should be able to say,
hey you know this does x, y,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.030
and z within a sentence.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.860
And so for example you know,
at Homejoy we started off

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:04.790
with something actually
super complicated.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.660
We&#39;re like we&#39;re an online
platform for home services.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.465
We started with cleaning and
you can choose you know,

00:13:10.465 --> 00:13:12.640
blah, and it just went off
for

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.770
paragraphs and paragraphs.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.650
We were present and we want
to you

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.400
know potential users to come
onto our platform.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.675
They just get kinda get
bored after that first

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:23.810
few sentences.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.010
And so what we found out was
that we really need this one

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.460
liner, the one liner is very
important an it kinda

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.208
describes the functional
benefit of what you do,

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:36.250
you know, in the future when
your trying to build a brand

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.770
you should, you know, be
able to describe, you know,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.640
what are emotional benefits
and stuff like that.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.680
But, you&#39;re starting with
new users, you really need

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.210
to tell them what they&#39;re
gonna get out of it.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.930
So we simply, after we
changed our positioning to

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:47.975
get your place clean for

00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:52.090
$20 an hour, then everyone
got it, and we&#39;re able to

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.860
get you know users to, users
in the door that way.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.020
So you have a MVP going out
there now how

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.180
do you get your first few
users to start trying it.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.790
So your first few users
should be you know,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.570
the obvious people,

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.580
the people that you&#39;re
connected with.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.800
You should use it obviously,
you and

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.280
your co-founder should be
using it.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.670
Your mom and dad should be
using it.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.530
Your friends and co-workers
should be using it.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.060
Beyond that you wanna get
more user feedback, and

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.890
so you, and I&#39;ve listed here
kind of some of

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.280
the obvious places to go to.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.200
And depending on what you&#39;re
selling, you know,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.448
you can take your pick of
the, pick of the draw here.

00:14:37.448 --> 00:14:39.872
So online communities
there&#39;s, you know,

00:14:39.872 --> 00:14:42.179
on Hacker News now, there&#39;s
the show HM.

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:43.906
That&#39;s a great place
especially if

00:14:43.906 --> 00:14:45.978
you&#39;re building tools for
developers and

00:14:45.978 --> 00:14:46.906
things like that.

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:48.435
Local communities, so

00:14:48.435 --> 00:14:51.035
if you&#39;re building consumer
product,

00:14:51.035 --> 00:14:54.703
you know, there are a lot of
influential local community

00:14:54.703 --> 00:14:58.525
mailing lists, especially
those for you know, parents,

00:14:58.525 --> 00:15:02.276
so those are places you
might want to head up to.

00:15:02.276 --> 00:15:03.297
okay.

00:15:03.297 --> 00:15:06.553
So when you go to by the
way, home joy,

00:15:06.553 --> 00:15:09.000
we actually tried all of
these.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.180
So, we use it ourself, that
was fine,

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.150
I mean we were on a cleaner,
so that was pretty easy.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.660
And then our parents lived
in Milwaukee and

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.850
so we were basically not
used to that in the work.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.570
Friends and coworkers are
kinda like in

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.540
San Francisco and else
where, so

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.520
we didn&#39;t have too many of
them use it.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.500
So we actually, if we ended
up in a dead end

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.450
of, not being about to
convince many people to

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.200
use this in the beginning.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.240
So what we did was because
we are in Mountain View,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.160
some of you might know on
Caster Street they have

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.180
street fairs there during
the summer time.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.520
And so we&#39;d go out and

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.730
basically chase down people
and

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.390
try to get them to book a
cleaning.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.920
And almost everyone would
say no.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.400
Until one day, we just took
advantage.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.170
You know, it was a very hot
and humid day.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.820
And what we noticed was, you
know, and

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.590
this was like any, at any
fair people you know,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.480
there might be arts and
crafts and things like that.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.240
And random people will you
know,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.340
gravitate towards that, but

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.780
everybody gravitates towards
the food and drink area.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.430
Especially on a hot day.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.120
So what we did was, okay, we
figured we need to get in

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.200
the middle of that, and by
getting in the middle of

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.440
that we just took water
bottles, froze them and

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.490
then we started handing out
free bottles of water that

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.880
were cold, and people just
came to us.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.000
I think we just basically
guilt tripped people

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.370
into booking cleanings.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.310
But the proof in the pudding
was that I figured most of

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.840
those people were guilt
tripped into doing it,

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.560
but, when they went home
they didn&#39;t cancel on us.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.330
Well, some of them did,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.240
but, a maj, majority of them
did not.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.660
And, so, we felt, like, I, I
thought, okay,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.720
that&#39;s good I gotta go clean
their houses, but, at least,

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.488
you know, there&#39;s something
we&#39;re actually solving here.

00:16:47.488 --> 00:16:53.470
so, and, you know, I don&#39;t
suggest,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.090
I think showing up the
fares, or another start up

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.110
in the last batch, I forgot
their name right now,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.990
but they, they, they, they
showed up,

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.092
they, they were selling
shipping type products.

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:09.150
Or were trying to replace
shipping products or

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.500
the content and mailing
stuff.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.733
And so they would show up to
the U.S. Postal Office and

00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:17.780
find people who were trying
to ship products.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.980
And just take them out of
line.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.220
Try to get them to use your
product.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.600
Have them ship it for you.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.010
So, you just have to go to
places where people

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.040
are going to really show up,
and, you know,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.090
your conversion rate is
gonna be really, really low,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.580
but to go from zero to one
to three to four, these

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.790
are the kind of things, you
might have to do.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.350
Okay.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.440
So, you got some users using
you.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.900
Now what do you do with all
these users?

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.200
Customer feedback.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.900
So, one, the first thing you
should do

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.580
is make sure there&#39;s a way
for people to contact you.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.150
So, support@homejoy.com.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:18:01.840
Ideally there&#39;s a phone
number, and if you hook up

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.880
a phone number, one really
good idea is to, make sure

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.480
that, you have voice mail or
something like that, so

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.210
you don&#39;t have to be picking
it up all the time.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.540
But in any case, a way for
people to get inbound,

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.410
to get inbound feedback is
good, but really what you

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.480
should be doing is going out
to your users and

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.730
talking with them, you know.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.970
Get away from your desk and

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.570
just get out and do the
work.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.350
It seems like a slog and
it&#39;s going to be a slog, but

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.510
this is where you&#39;re going
to get the best feedback

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.280
ever for your product.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.830
And this is gonna teach you
on what features you need to

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.480
completely change, get rid
of,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.720
or what features you need to
build.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.360
And so, one way to do this
is to send out surveys, you

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.730
know, to get reviews after
they&#39;ve used the product.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.450
This is okay, but generally,
you know, people are only

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.520
gonna respond if they really
love you or really hate you.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.900
And, you never get like the
in between, So kind of

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.120
get in between not get all
the extremes is to go out

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.660
an actually meet the person
that is using your product.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:10.470
And, it&#39;s not a good idea
to,

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.690
you know, I&#39;ve seen people
go out meet the user and

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.820
they sit there and it&#39;s like
a laboratory and

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.690
it&#39;s like an inquisition
almost?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.450
And you&#39;re kind of just like
poking, and poking, and

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.360
poking at them like why&#39;d
you do that?

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.400
Why&#39;d you do that?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.150
That&#39;s not going to give you
the best results.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.950
What you should really do is
make it into a conversation.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.670
Get to know them, get them
to feel comfortable,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.870
because you want to get them
at a level where they are,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.162
they feel like, you know,

00:19:35.162 --> 00:19:37.770
they should be honest with
you to help you an, an,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.490
and improve, improve things
for you.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.480
So I found that actually
taking people out for

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.460
drinks and stuff like that
was a very good

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.780
way to do that.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.830
I&#39;m not sure if all of you
are old enough to do that,

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:50.000
but you can take them for
coffee.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.330
So another way,

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.070
another thing you should be
tracking is.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.480
How are you doing in
general,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.260
like from like the macro
perspective.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.580
And the best way to do that
is by tracking

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.430
customer retention.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.410
That is, the number of
people that came in the door

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.720
today, how many are coming
back tomorrow, the next day,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.580
and so on and so forth.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.822
Usually over time you&#39;re
kinda looking at,

00:20:13.822 --> 00:20:16.750
you know, monthly retention
so.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.857
You know, people who came in
the door today are they

00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:20.900
still using it next month
and so and so forth.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.760
The problem with that
metri,c is that it&#39;s you

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.940
know, it takes forever to
collect that data.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.750
And you don&#39;t have,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.595
sometimes you don&#39;t have a
month or two months or

00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:30.790
three months to, you know,
to figure that out.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.477
So good leading indicator is
actually collecting reviews

00:20:34.477 --> 00:20:37.620
and ratings like five star,
four star reviews.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.730
Are collecting some notion
of

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.930
NPS which is Net Promoter
Score.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.130
So you&#39;re basically asking
them

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.600
from a rating from zero to
ten,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.690
how likely are they to
recommend you to a friend.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.590
And calculating the NPS.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.940
And so over time what you&#39;ll
see is,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.570
as you&#39;re building a new
feature, is you should be

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.560
able to see that the reviews
or the retention is going up

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.910
over time which means you&#39;re
doing a good job.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.730
If it&#39;s going down,

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:01.720
you&#39;re doing a bad job, and
if it&#39;s kind of staying

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.580
the same that means you
probably need to go out and

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.300
figure out what new things
you should be building.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.120
The other thing is,

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.310
I&#39;ll get to the qualitative
thing later, but

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.090
the one thing you should be
worried of is the honesty

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.010
curve, which is some people
will just lie to you.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:30.490
So, I mean, this is

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.790
like degrees of separation
from you, and

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.350
this is like level of
honesty.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.900
Like so here it&#39;s, here this
is your mom.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.248
This is like your friends of
friends and

00:21:44.248 --> 00:21:47.180
here&#39;s like random people.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:51.580
I don&#39;t know if you can all
see this but, so

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.998
you&#39;re mom is going to be
you know.

00:21:53.998 --> 00:21:56.640
They, she should use your
product, but

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.070
she&#39;s going to be proud of
you anyway, and so

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.760
she&#39;ll maybe be honest like
this much.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.390
And your friends will, you
know,

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.561
they&#39;ll be pretty honest
with you and

00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:05.940
give you feedback because
they care about you.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.230
By the way, this is assuming
it&#39;s

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.537
a free product that you&#39;re
giving them.

00:22:10.743 --> 00:22:11.660
&gt;&gt; And.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.740
Then over time, like as you
get more and more random,

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.790
these people don&#39;t even know
who you are, it doesn&#39;t go

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.670
like this really, but it
kind of goes like this.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.270
Where people don&#39;t care
about giving you

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.670
feedback they just like okay
here&#39;s a survey, ta, ta, ta,

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.540
tat and so you should take

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.460
this into consideration when
getting user feedback.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.760
Now let&#39;s say you make, you
pay.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.020
It&#39;s a pay product, right?

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.928
Well let&#39;s just do this in
green.

00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:38.040
So, the paid, you know,

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.530
your mom is gonna be like
down here.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.900
Like, she&#39;s just gonna lie
to you and say, you know,

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.800
she&#39;s just gonna feel sorry
and

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.610
say, this is a great product
of course.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.160
But then you, kind of goes
like this, right?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.220
Which is to say that your
friends are kinda gonna

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.340
give you the right, they&#39;re,
they wanna support you and

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.500
give you the right feedback.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.590
But it&#39;s actually these
random people up here that,

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.600
you know, if they,

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.320
if they really don&#39;t think
what they paid for

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.370
was worth it, they&#39;re gonna
really tell you.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.308
Because you know, it&#39;s money
out the door.

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:16.550
And so, this is another way
of saying you&#39;re going to

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.530
get the best feedback.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.110
Obviously, down here, you&#39;re
gonna get more feedback

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.850
if you just make someone pay
for it.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.540
That&#39;s not to say you
should, you know, and

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.630
the first time make out make
people pay for it.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.980
That it is to say that you
should, if you&#39;re going to

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.680
build a product that you&#39;re
going to eventually need to,

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.830
you know, they&#39;re going to
pay for the software or

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.860
for the hardware, whatever,
you should do that.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.530
Get to the point where you
can do that very, very fast.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.560
Because then that&#39;s when you
get

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.300
the real meaty stuff to help
you in the future of

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.320
how you can get more paying
users in the door.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.420
All right so, you&#39;re getting
a lot of feedback and,

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.210
what do you do before you
laun,

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.050
officially launch the
product?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.650
So what you want to do is,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.640
you always want to be
building fast, right?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.250
And you want to be
optimizing for

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.000
this stage of growth.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.102
That is you,

00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:15.990
you know, you might have ten
users at this point.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.360
Don&#39;t, theres no point in
trying to build features for

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.320
the point when you have a
million users.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.210
You want to optimize for the
next stage of growth,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.440
which is gonna be ten to a
hundred users.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.720
What are features you really
need for

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.736
that and just go with that.

00:24:30.736 --> 00:24:32.223
Some times.

00:24:32.223 --> 00:24:35.790
And basically on the slide
is just many ways of

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.890
stating that notion.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.080
Manual before automation.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.930
One of the things that I
found when

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.210
building a market place is
that process is very,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.460
very important over time as
you scale.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.560
But you need not try to
automate everything and

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.070
create software to just have
robots just run everything.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:54.920
What you should really do to
understand what you

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.190
should really build, is to
manually do it yourself.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.880
And an example of this is
when we started taking

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.900
on cleaning professionals
onto our platform.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.060
We would have them,um,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.490
we would ask them a bunch of
questions.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.410
Over the phone and

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.190
then in person we ask them a
bunch of questions too.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:19.210
And then they would go to a
test clean and

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.100
then they would get on
boarded to our platform if

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:25.610
they&#39;re good enough.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.470
And so this took a lot.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.240
During all this question
askings for

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.440
that many candidates.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.150
You know, we had about a 3
to 5 % acceptance rate.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.610
And so you can imagine all
the people we

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.140
were talking to at the
beginning of the funnel

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.570
that never even made it onto
the platform.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.400
But what happened over time
was that

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.470
we learned certain
questions.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.410
That were asking, were, that
were

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.470
indicators of whether
they&#39;re gonna be a good, or

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.970
a bad, performer on the
platform.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.940
We, threw just like data
collection and

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.560
just you know, looking at,
looking at everything,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.790
we could just ask on an
online forum.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.500
So that&#39;s when we put on,
put in online application.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.177
They could apply and then we
would ask them maybe several

00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:13.206
of the questions during the
inter, personal interview.

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:15.850
So it&#39;s, if you try to
automate things too fast,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.770
then you run into this
problem,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.310
potential problem of, you
know, not being able to move

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.020
quickly on trying to iterate
you know with things like

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.620
questions on an application
and stuff like that.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.210
And the third point here is
temporary brokenness is

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.780
much better than permanent
paralysis.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.660
By that, what I mean is you
know

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.770
perfection is irrelevant
during this stage.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.540
You should, when you get to
the next stage of growth,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.800
like what you&#39;re trying to
maybe perfect in this one

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.030
stage, is probably going to
not matter anyway, and

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.960
so do not worry about all
the edge cases when you&#39;re

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.680
building something.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.720
Just worry about the generic
case of who your

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.580
core user is gonna be, and
then as you get bigger and

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.740
bigger, bigger, the volume
of

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.970
those edge cases will
increase over time.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.910
And you&#39;ll want to, you
know, build for that.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.880
And lastly, beware of the
frankenstein approach,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.230
which is great.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.400
You talk to all these users,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.410
they give you all these
ideas, you know,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.380
the first thing your gonna
wanna do is go build

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.420
every single one of them,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:21.110
and go show them the next
day and, make them happier.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.320
You should definitely listen
to user feedback but

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.590
when someone tells you to
build a feature,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.680
you shouldn&#39;t go build that
right away.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.480
What you should really do
is, you know,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.450
get to the bottom of why
they are asking you to

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.360
build the feature.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.050
It&#39;s usually.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.210
Usually what they&#39;re
suggesting is

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.180
not the best idea.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.540
But what they&#39;re really
suggesting is,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.910
I have this other problem
that you either created for

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.460
me while using the product.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.630
Or, you know, I really need
this problem solved before

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.670
I&#39;m ever going to pay to use
this product, and so, figure

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.470
that out first, instead of
piling on a bunch of

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.636
features, which then hides
the problem altogether.

00:27:56.636 --> 00:27:58.460
So, you have, so

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:04.840
you have a product, that
you&#39;re ready to show, and.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.010
Some people at this point
will continue building their

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.226
product and not ship it at
all.

00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:19.690
And, I think the whole idea
of being stealth and

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.810
perfecting the product to no
end is.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:32.270
Is the idea that, you know,
imitation is cheaper

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:36.660
than innovation in terms of
time and money and capital.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:40.870
And so, I think everyone
should just always assume in

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.150
general like, there&#39;s gonna
be,

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.070
if you have a really good
idea.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.350
No matter when you launch.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.150
Someone&#39;s gonna, someone&#39;s
gonna,be you know,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.540
someones gonna fast follow
you.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.520
Someone&#39;s gonna execute,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.300
as hard as they possible can
to catch up with you.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.410
And so, there&#39;s not point in
holding out on all the user

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.710
feed back that you can get
by getting a lot of users.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.005
Because you feel like, you
know, you feel paranoid that

00:29:04.005 --> 00:29:05.070
someones&#39; gonna do this to
you.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.210
And I hate to keep harping
on it,

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.210
but this is things that I
see today with founders,

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.810
is something I went through
as well.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.890
And I think unless you&#39;re,
unless you&#39;re building

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.680
something that requires
hundr,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.840
like tens of millions of
dollars just to start up,

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.510
there, there&#39;s really no
point in,

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.390
in waiting around to launch
your product.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.000
So say you have something
that you feel ready to get

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.930
lots of users on.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.490
So what do you do at this
point?

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:36.050
So I&#39;ll look at my time, so.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.100
&gt;&gt; 20 minutes.
&gt;&gt; 20 minutes?

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.650
Okay.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.400
So, I will go over,

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.032
various types of growths in
the next slides.

00:29:45.032 --> 00:29:46.994
But the one thing to note
here,

00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:49.560
early on when you are trying
to get,

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.353
when it&#39;s just you and your
co-founder and

00:29:52.353 --> 00:29:56.507
maybe, like, a couple other
people building, you&#39;re not

00:29:56.507 --> 00:29:59.931
gonna be a, you know, create
a team just for growth.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:02.526
It, it&#39;s gonna be one person
and one person only.

00:30:02.526 --> 00:30:05.209
And so, you need to really
focus and you need to,

00:30:05.209 --> 00:30:08.154
you should only, you&#39;re
gonna be tempted to try like

00:30:08.154 --> 00:30:10.800
five different strategies at
one time.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.650
But really, what you should
do is take one channel and

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.120
really execute on it for an
entire week,

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.740
and, and just focus on that.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.040
And then if that works,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.520
continue executing on it
until it caps out.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.770
If it doesn&#39;t work, then
just move on.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:28.290
By doing this, you will feel
more certain that,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.280
that channel that you were
working on,

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.428
that initial hypothesis is
wrong.

00:30:34.428 --> 00:30:37.650
You&#39;ll be, then if you tried
only working a third of your

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.520
time on it over the course
of, three or four weeks.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.750
So, learn one channel at a
time.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.060
Second is always be, when
you find channels that work,

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.960
you find strategies that
work,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.270
always be iterating on it.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.810
You can potentially give it
to some,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.680
like create a playbook and

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.230
give it to somebody else to
iterate on it.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.850
But these channels always
change.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.992
You know, anything from
Facebook ads to,

00:31:01.992 --> 00:31:05.265
even Google ads, to you
know?

00:31:05.265 --> 00:31:10.180
But, the distribution
channels the environments

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:11.670
that you don&#39;t control,
change all the time,

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.390
and so you should be

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.690
always iterating optimizing
for that.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.120
And lastly, in the beginning
you&#39;re probably,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.220
when you see a channel that
fails you,

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.840
just get rid of it and go on
and move on.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.380
There&#39;s many other things to
try.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.390
But over time,

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.970
go back to those channels
and look at it again.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.260
And so, what I mean by that
is an example is,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.180
in the beginning at Homejoy,
we had no money.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.900
When we tried to do, we
tried to

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.410
buy users from Merry Maid,
not from Merry Maids,

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.240
that&#39;s just an example of a
competitor, but.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.230
We tried to buy Google ads
to get users in

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.900
the door quickly.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:54.060
And what we found was that
Merry Maids,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.240
Molly Maids, all these other
national companies,

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.680
they had more money than us.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.310
They were making out

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:00.240
a lot more money on the job
than us.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.910
And so they were able to pay
for users at a much higher

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.560
at a much higher, at a much
higher,they were able to

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.100
acquire them at a much
higher cost than us.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.010
And so, we couldn&#39;t afford
that,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.690
and we had to go to another
channel,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.060
which turned out to be
something else.

00:32:15.872 --> 00:32:18.700
But today we make more money
on the job.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.210
We&#39;re much better at certain
things, and

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.350
so we should probably
revisit the idea of buying

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:26.853
Google ads and buying, going
to the S.D.M. Channel.

00:32:26.853 --> 00:32:28.910
And so what that&#39;s what I
mean by that.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.552
And the key to all this is
creativity.

00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:33.900
Performance marketing or
marketing or

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.980
growth in general can be
very technical.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.040
But it&#39;s actually technical
and

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.260
you have to be creative
because if it wasn&#39;t,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.310
if it was really easy and

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.570
bland, like everyone would
be growing right now.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.860
And so, you always have to
find, like,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.952
that little thing that no
one else is doing and

00:32:51.952 --> 00:32:53.898
do that to the extreme.

00:32:53.898 --> 00:32:58.942
So, here are three types of
growth

00:32:58.942 --> 00:33:04.290
when yeah, three types of
growth,

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.090
sticky, viral and paid
growth and hopefully,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.910
I&#39;ll get enough time to talk
about all of this.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.430
So really, briefly,

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.700
sticky growth is trying to
get your existing users to

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.270
come back and pay you more
or use you more.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.110
Second is viral growth.

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.560
So that&#39;s when people talk
about you.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.110
So, you use a product, you
really like it,

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:27.850
then you tell ten other
friends.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.280
They like it and that&#39;s
viral growth.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280
And the third is paid
growth.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.140
So, if you happen to have
money in the bank,

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.020
you are going to be able to
perhaps use part of that

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.009
money to buy growth.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.980
And the central theme I&#39;m

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.610
gonna go through is
sustainability.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.905
There&#39;s a lot of, by
sustainable growth I mean,

00:33:46.905 --> 00:33:49.570
you&#39;re basically not a leaky
bucket.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.590
Money you put in or

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.340
time you put in, has a good
return on investment on it.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.600
So, sticky growth is like I
said,

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.940
getting existing users to
keep buying stuff.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:08.430
So, the only thing that
really matters here is that

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.750
you deliver a good
experience, right?

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.800
If you deliver a good
experience,

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.770
people are gonna keep
wanting to use you.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.350
If you deliver an addictive
experience,

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.990
people are gonna keep
wanting to use you.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.760
And the way to measure this
and

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.850
to really look at this and

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:27.420
how you&#39;re doing over time
of whether you are providing

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.410
good sticky growth is to
look at the CLV&#39;s and

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:32.630
retention cohort analysis.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.280
Now, does anyone not know
what cohort analysis is,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.430
or should I go over it?

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:38.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:39.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So I&#39;ll go over it.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:40.300
Okay.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.760
So CLV is some people call
it LTV.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.000
It is called customer
lifetime,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.260
which is, basically the
amount of the net

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.650
revenue that a customer
brings in the door for

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.000
you over a certain amount of
period.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.950
So, a 12 month CLV is how
much net revenue

00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:00.370
does a customer give you
over 12 months.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.470
Sometimes people look at
three months, six months,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.040
and so on and so forth.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.200
So, when I say cohort,
basically,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.220
what you&#39;re looking at is,
this is time.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.450
So, let&#39;s just call this,
yeah, time.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:23.260
So, and this is percent of
users coming back to you.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.158
So at time zero, right, a
period zero,

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:29.231
we&#39;re at a hundred.

00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:36.301
I&#39;m using 100%.

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:39.181
So, cohort is another name
also for

00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:42.837
like customer segments and
stuff like that.

00:35:42.837 --> 00:35:43.381
So you can,

00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:45.949
like, you might look at the
female versus male cohort.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.119
People in Atlanta Georgia
verses people in

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:53.015
Sacramento California.

00:35:53.015 --> 00:35:58.518
But, the most common one is
by month.

00:35:58.518 --> 00:36:02.850
So, cohort equals month and
lets just say for

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:07.524
this exercise, we are
looking at like March of,

00:36:07.524 --> 00:36:10.158
I don&#39;t know, 2012.

00:36:10.158 --> 00:36:15.218
So, March 2012, 100% of
people, you&#39;ll have like,

00:36:15.218 --> 00:36:18.041
that means n equals 100
people.

00:36:18.041 --> 00:36:21.079
So, 100% of the people,
obviously, are using your

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:23.498
product because, that&#39;s the
definition.

00:36:23.498 --> 00:36:28.234
Now, one month later, you
might have,

00:36:28.234 --> 00:36:31.577
this scale is not right, but

00:36:31.577 --> 00:36:37.020
50% might come back and so,
you come here.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.900
Now, in the second month,
how many people that came in

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.510
March, come back two months
later?

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.100
And that might be down here.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.560
And, so, over time,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:51.420
you&#39;ll have a curve that
looks like this.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.190
There&#39;s always some initial
drop off, you know.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.730
The reasons why people don&#39;t
stay after their first use

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:01.970
is, it wasn&#39;t worth it, had
a bad experience,

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.290
stuff like that.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:07.950
And then, over time what you
want is, you want this to

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.148
flatten out over time, so
that your turn basically

00:37:12.148 --> 00:37:15.310
goes to 0% that means you
attrition out less, and

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.300
less users over time.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.480
And these over here, kind of
become your core customers,

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.720
these are the ones that are
like sort of staying

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.289
with you for a long time.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.800
And now, court analysis or

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.260
using this as a way to show
if you have sticky growth or

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:42.270
not is now, say you&#39;re, say
we&#39;re one year later and

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.190
you&#39;ve built a bunch of
stuff right?

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.490
You graph out the same thing
and hopefully what you&#39;ll

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.920
see is that you have a curve
like this.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.785
That is in the first period
even more people than

00:37:56.785 --> 00:38:00.100
50% came back to you and
more and

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.290
more people are sticking
with you.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.750
A really bad, retention
curve looks like this, which

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.290
is like, after the first use
they just hate you so

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.030
much, no, like no one even
comes back.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.480
It&#39;s just like zero, right.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.180
And, I don&#39;t know what kind
of business that is.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.025
I mean it&#39;s obviously a
shitty business, but

00:38:16.025 --> 00:38:20.780
like I can&#39;t explain a good
business that has

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.660
a retention curve like that.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.050
So anyway, so over time as
you are thinking of

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.800
strategies to increase this
curve,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.160
like keep making it go up
and up and

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.170
up, you want to basically
look at this analysis,

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.580
over time to see if that
strategy is working for you.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.358
Okay, does that make sense?

00:38:43.358 --> 00:38:46.850
Okay, cool.

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:51.188
The second kind of growth is
viral growth and like sticky

00:38:51.188 --> 00:38:55.169
growth you need to also
deliver a good experience.

00:38:55.169 --> 00:38:57.379
But on top of that you need
to deliver a really,

00:38:57.379 --> 00:38:59.989
really good experience,
like, what&#39;s going to make

00:38:59.989 --> 00:39:02.598
these people shout out loud
on Twitter, on Facebook or

00:39:02.598 --> 00:39:04.470
whatever and tell all their
friends and

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.107
email all their friends and
family members about you.

00:39:07.107 --> 00:39:08.980
You have to really deliver a
good experience.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.120
Combined with that is, u
need to have really good

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.780
mechanics for the referral
program itself, like,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.800
you have a hundred customers
who really wanna talk

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.950
about you now, how are they
going to talk about you?

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.960
So, in that sense a viral
growth,

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.090
the viral growth strategy is
all really about one

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:29.130
building good experience,
but if you have that,

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:30.900
it&#39;s how do you build a good
referral program.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.390
And so I&#39;ve listed the three
main parts of that.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.727
One is the customer touch
points, which is,

00:39:36.727 --> 00:39:41.660
where are people,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.280
learning that they can refer
other people.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.180
So, that might be just,
after they book, or

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.882
after they sign up there is
a,

00:39:48.882 --> 00:39:51.600
usually you see these like,
right after you sign up for,

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.555
for whatever reason most,
for whatever reason most

00:39:53.555 --> 00:39:55.900
people just immediately tell
you to invite other friends,

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.260
even though you&#39;ve never
used the product before.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.571
And so, but that&#39;s a
customer touch point,

00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:00.510
is just right after you sign
up.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.660
A better one is after they
use the product after

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.280
a while, and you see that
they&#39;re highly engaged,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.490
then to show them that link
and

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.630
get them to send it out to
everyone.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.140
Another one is if

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.780
you&#39;re doing more of a
platform type play like, for

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.870
Homejoy we actually go
inside their homes.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:18.310
So now, the customer touch
point is when the cleaning

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.340
professional is inside the
home,

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:20.830
they can have a leave
behind,

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:23.220
and, we can show them
something there too as well.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.930
so, you wanna basically put
the customer touch points

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:32.930
and put the actual, link or
whatever it is, how they&#39;re

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:35.320
gonna refer all their
friends at a point in time

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.440
when they&#39;re highly engaged
and they&#39;re loving you.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.390
Second is program mechanics.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.290
And so that&#39;s where, like,
the most common thing that

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:47.558
I&#39;ve seen is $10 for $10,
that is, you get $10 if you

00:40:47.558 --> 00:40:50.440
invite your friend and they
use it and they get $10.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.050
And so, you should try
different types of

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.330
mechanics in that sense and

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:57.010
try to optimize for whatever
works for you.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.280
You know, it could be 25 for
25,

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:02.370
it could be ten for zero, it
could many of these things.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.400
And lastly it&#39;s when the,
when your friend clicks on

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.680
the link, on your referral
link, when they come back to

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.720
the site, it&#39;s very
important to really optimize

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.110
that conversion flow of how
they&#39;re going to sign up.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.390
And so sometimes you need to
just sell them in

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:24.390
a different manner, or
upsell that their friend has

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:26.560
suggested they use this and
so on and so forth.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.790
So, all these combined, you
need to really play

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:35.470
around with these on
different dimensions and

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.640
come up with a good referral
program.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:39.670
And, lastly, it&#39;s paid
growth, so,

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.990
examples of paid growth is
this right here.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.580
And these are the most
obvious ones, but

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.860
I&#39;m sure you guys can think
of more.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.890
And paid growth is
basically,

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.690
you happen to have money,
you can spend.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.580
You might have credit cards,
whatever, but

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.789
you can spend something to
get users.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:02.300
So, the correct way to think
about pay to growth is that,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.240
okay you&#39;re going to put
money.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.504
You&#39;re gonna risk putting
money out there,

00:42:05.504 --> 00:42:07.920
what are you gonna get in
return?

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.930
The simple way to think
about it is, is your CLV,

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.670
your customer lifetime, the
amount of money,

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.750
the net revenue, the amount
of money that people,

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.120
that your customer returns
back to you,

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.790
is it more than your CAC?

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.770
And your CAC is an
abbreviation for

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.100
customer acquisition cost.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:32.710
So, an example is, you pay,
actually the slide

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.260
here has an example here, so
say you run a bunch of ads.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.950
These are four ads.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:41.280
Over 12 months,

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.440
the customer&#39;s worth $300 to
you.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.050
Each one of these ads, when
you click on it,

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:52.770
the CPC costs different
types of money.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.370
And then, when they click on
the ad, then they have to

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.000
come to your site and sign
up or buy something, and

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.632
the conversion rates are
different for all these ads.

00:43:00.632 --> 00:43:04.650
And then, the CAC is
calculated simply by

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.320
the CPC divided by the
conversion.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.740
And so, you see that there&#39;s

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.110
different acquisition costs
for different types of ads.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.530
And to determine whether,
that is a good ad or

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.150
a bad ad, all you have to do
is, CLV minus CAC.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.030
Is it more than zero?

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.860
If it&#39;s at zero then you&#39;ve,
that&#39;s fine, but

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.790
hopefully it&#39;s actually more

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:29.840
than zero until you actually
are earning a profit on it.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.670
So, we see that, despite the
sales remaining the same and

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.670
the conversions being higher
and lower,

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:38.810
there&#39;s sometimes, some ads
that might seem good,

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.020
actually don&#39;t seem so good
at the end of the day.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.380
Now, the advanced way of
looking at it is you can

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.790
look at this for your whole
entire customer base for

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:50.740
aggregating all your
customers together.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.990
But the better way of

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.955
looking at it is to break it
down by customer segments.

00:43:54.955 --> 00:44:01.490
So, if you have for example,
if you&#39;re building

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.530
a marketplace, I don&#39;t know,
for country music,

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.550
the CLV&#39;s of someone in
Nashville Tennessee is going

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.478
to be much larger than the
CLV&#39;s and

00:44:10.478 --> 00:44:13.820
latent value of someone in
Czechoslovakia.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.000
So, or, I just assume that&#39;s
the case anyway.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.680
So, you&#39;ll need to, you want
to make sure that when

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.740
you&#39;re buying ads for these
different types of cohorts,

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.610
or these types of customer
segments,

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.320
that you know what the
differences are.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.210
You don&#39;t wanna mix like,
everything together.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.880
So, the last one on payback
time is sustainability.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.233
I think a lot of businesses
get in trouble, and

00:44:45.233 --> 00:44:48.173
it turns into a bad business
when they start

00:44:48.173 --> 00:44:50.307
spending beyond their means.

00:44:50.307 --> 00:44:54.303
And it has a lot to do with
risk tolerance, or

00:44:54.303 --> 00:44:58.085
how much risk you&#39;re willing
to take on.

00:44:58.085 --> 00:45:01.688
So, when you look at CLV&#39;s
of these.

00:45:01.688 --> 00:45:05.626
Let&#39;s just suppose you get a
customer a customer who&#39;s

00:45:05.626 --> 00:45:08.809
worth $300 after 12 months,
that is,

00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:12.020
in the first month they&#39;re
worth $100.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.800
If you wait til the end of
the 12 month period,

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.870
then they give you the other
$200.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.615
But if, in the first period
you&#39;re actually paying

00:45:21.615 --> 00:45:26.434
$200 for them, then you&#39;re
in the whole for

00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:29.740
$100 until the end of the 12
month period.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.180
And that&#39;s when you start
getting into

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.319
potentially unsustainable
growth, which is

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.320
something could happen where
at the end of the 12 months,

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.320
you don&#39;t actually get the
$200 from the customer, and

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.270
you end up in a very bad
situation and

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:51.080
essentially just at the end
of the day,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.100
you could be running out of
money.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.290
And if you&#39;re doing this
with credit cards,

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:58.930
you will definitely find
that you&#39;re gonna have to,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.610
you know, declare bankruptcy
very soon.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.990
So again, payback time is
very important, a safe one

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:10.810
to go with is 3 months if
you have very high risk,

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:14.780
if you&#39;re very risk loving,
maybe 12 months is better.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.990
Beyond 12 months is very
much an unsafe territory.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.068
How much time do I have?

00:46:24.068 --> 00:46:29.160
A minute, okay.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:35.210
So, I&#39;ll just go into this,
the art of pivoting.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.150
So a lot of people ask me,
Homejoy went through,

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.460
Homejoy in its current
concept is

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.050
literally the thirteenth
idea we fully built out and

00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:49.530
try and execute on and try
to get customers for.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.740
And so, a lot of the
questions I get

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.300
is how did you even, like,
get to that thirteenth idea?

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.850
And how&#39;d you decide when to
move on.

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.850
And so the best guidance I
can give on that is,

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.570
to kind of look at these
three criteria, which is,

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.630
once you realize you can&#39;t
grow, or once you realize,

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:13.420
you are despite building out
all these great features and

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.190
talking to all these users.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.010
None of them stick, or you
don&#39;t

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:20.010
have any good high retaining
users, or the economics of

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.900
the business just doesn&#39;t
make sense, then once you

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.920
make that realization, you
just need to move on.

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:29.410
And I think the trickiest
one is probably the growth

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.760
one, because there&#39;s so many
stories out there

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.540
where the founder stuck with
the idea, and then,

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.610
after three years, all of a
sudden it started growing.

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.550
So, the trick here is
basically,

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.690
what you really should do
is,

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:45.932
you should have a growth
plan when you start out,

00:47:45.932 --> 00:47:51.410
which is you should ideally
just have, what is

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:56.300
an optimistic but realistic
way to grow this business?

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:00.190
And so, it might look
something like this.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:04.223
And this is T and this is
number of users.

00:48:04.223 --> 00:48:11.870
So, in week one you want,
you just want one user.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.680
In week two you want maybe
two users and

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.390
so and so forth.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:18.040
And you can keep doubling up
and up.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.470
So, in week one you should
basically do

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:23.400
as much as possible,

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.300
build whatever you have to
build to get that one user.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.810
And then in week two, so on,
so forth, you build whatever

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.600
you need to get two users,
four users, eight users.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.560
In the beginning it should
be fairly, if you

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.310
have a product that people
actually wan,t you should be

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.600
able to maintain this growth
curve pretty easily just by

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:41.210
walking around and manually
finding people.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.840
It&#39;s when you get to like,
you need 100 users a week,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.240
or you need some of these
more,

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.120
you need the growth
strategies to start working.

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.160
And so, what I tell people
is usually if you&#39;re fully

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.139
executing on your product,
and you&#39;re really

00:48:55.139 --> 00:48:58.639
working really, really hard,
then, if you go three or

00:48:58.639 --> 00:49:01.916
four weeks in a row of no
growth, backwards growth,

00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:05.490
then either, then it&#39;s time
to maybe consider a pivot,

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.245
in the sense that not
starting over, like,

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:10.360
completely come with a new
idea.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.831
But you&#39;re probably
fundamentally doing

00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:13.584
something wrong, because, in
that early stage of

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:15.070
a start up, you should
always be growing.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.170
And, so, it&#39;s not.

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:21.320
And this is optimistically
what it looks like.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.390
And this is like, kind of
the growth curve I set forth

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.730
and put out when I started
Home Joy.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.520
But really what it looks
like is like this.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:33.720
And so you wanna make sure
that when you&#39;re in

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.980
a low like over here, that
you don&#39;t just stop, right?

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.440
And that&#39;s why you should
wait two to three weeks,as

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.090
long as you keep working
hard, you&#39;ll eventually get

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.663
back here and you&#39;ll see a
trend like this over time.

00:49:43.663 --> 00:49:50.741
Cool, so that&#39;s pivoting

00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:54.790
and that&#39;s it.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.528
I can take questions at this
point.

00:49:56.528 --> 00:50:04.010
&gt;&gt; Answer one question.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
One question?

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.200
&gt;&gt; So one question online
was, if your users have a

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.110
product that they&#39;re already
somewhat comfortable with,

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:11.760
how do you get them to
switch to your&#39;s?

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.420
&gt;&gt; Right so, there&#39;s a
switch over costs.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.850
I&#39;ll tell you the example of
Homejoy.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:19.830
So, Homejoy,

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.760
we actually were creating a
new market in the sense that

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.320
a lot of our initial users
never had cleaning before.

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.290
So, it was pretty simple to
get them on board.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:30.860
And a lot of people who have
cleaners already,

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.660
really trust their cleaner
and they will.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:38.670
To get them to come and use
something else is actually,

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.440
probably the most difficult
task in the world.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.920
And so, when you&#39;re billing
things and trying to

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.860
get people to switch over to
you, what you really need to

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.260
do is find the moments where
your product or

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.590
what your offering is much
better or very

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:55.600
much differentiated from the
existing solution they have.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.360
So, an example is someone
who had a regular cleaner

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.070
and maybe they had a party
one day and

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.770
they needed a cleaning
almost the next day.

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:04.250
And because Homejoy,

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.140
in most of the areas has
next day availability,

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:08.010
they would just come to
Homejoy and use it, because

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:09.990
they knew they couldn&#39;t get
their regular cleaner.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.880
And once they start using
the product,

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.230
then that&#39;s when they start
realizing the advantage,

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:18.740
the little advantages of
using Homejoy which adds up

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:19.460
to a big advantage.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.912
So, a lot of things are,

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:26.250
realizing that, leaving cash
out, or

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.180
leaving checks was really
annoying, and so billing

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.180
through online payments was
more convenient.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.930
Being able to book, cancel,
and reschedule, according to

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.990
your own schedule was very
convenient and so

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.526
and so forth.

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:41.660
And so, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s
really hard to,

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.370
a lot of people when they
build the product,

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:46.910
they&#39;re like, and these 50
things are better than,

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.150
a little bit better than,
the existing solution.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:52.510
It&#39;s really hard, even if
the benefits outweigh

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:53.500
the switch-over costs.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:58.190
It&#39;s really hard to actually
tell that to a user and

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:02.420
try to get them to aggregate
all those benefits over many

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:02.960
little things.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.000
It&#39;s better to just have one
or two things that clearly

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.380
differentiate yourself from
the product so.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.155
&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

00:52:18.155 --> 00:52:18.745
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:52:18.745 --> 00:52:21.590
Okay.

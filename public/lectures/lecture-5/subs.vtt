WEBVTT

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.798
Good afternoon.

00:00:05.798 --> 00:00:08.151
Today&#39;s speaker is Peter
Thiel.

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:10.568
Peter, was the founder of
PayPal, and

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:14.159
Palantir, and Founders Fund,
and has invested in most of

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.591
the tech companies in
Silicon Valley.

00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:19.279
And he&#39;s going to talk about
strategy and competition.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.790
Thank you for coming, Peter.
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.640
Thanks, Sam.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.410
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.542
Thanks for having me.

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:29.118
I sorta, I have a single a
day

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:33.040
fixed that I&#39;m completely
obsessed with in.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.080
On the business side which
is that, if you&#39;re starting

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.120
a company, if you&#39;re the
founder,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.670
entrepreneur starting a
company,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.680
you always want to aim for

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.240
monopoly, and that you want
to always avoid competition.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.250
Hence, competition is for
losers.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740
Something we&#39;ll be talking
about today.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
I&#39;d like to start by saying
something

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.980
about the basic idea of when
you start one

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.580
of these companies how you
go about, creating value?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.992
And this question, what
makes a business valuable?

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:12.180
And I wanna, suggest that
there&#39;s basically,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080
a very simple very simple
formula that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.430
you, have a valuable company
two things are true.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
Number one, that it creates
X dollars of value for

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.250
the world.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.339
And number two, that you
capture Y% of X.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:34.460
And the critical thing that
I think people always miss

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.970
in the sort of analysis is
that X and y are completely

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.710
independent variables, and
so X can be very big.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.960
Y can be very small.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.830
X can be of intermediate
size.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.450
And if Y is, is reasonably
big you can still get

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.780
a very big business.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.900
So, to create a valuable
company you have to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.910
basically, both create
something of value and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.180
capture some fraction of

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.160
the value of what you&#39;ve
created.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.930
And sort of,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.070
just to illustrate this is a
contrast.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.190
If you sorta, compare the US
airline industry with

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.440
a company like Google on
search.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.470
If you sorta, measure by

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.160
the size of these industries
you could, you could say

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.920
that airlines are still more
important than search.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.400
If you just measure it say
by revenues.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.930
There&#39;s 195 billion.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.750
In domestic revenues in
2012.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.310
Google had just north of 50
billion.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.390
And certainly, sort of on
some intuitive level,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.520
if you said, if you were
given a choice and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.350
said well do you want to get
rid of all air travel.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.690
Or do you want to get rid of
your ability to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.940
use search engines?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.520
The intuition would be that
air travel is

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.300
something that&#39;s more
important than search.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.850
And this is, of course, just
the domestic numbers.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.490
If you had looked at this
globally, airlines are much,

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.920
much bigger than search, or
Google, is But

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.520
the profit margins are quite
a bit less.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.060
You know,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.180
they were marginally
profitable in 2012.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.750
Think entire hundred year
history of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.940
the airline industry.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.310
The cumulative profits in
the U.S.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.030
have been approximately
zero.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.180
The companies make money.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.510
They episodically go
bankrupt.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.130
They get re-capitalized and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.400
you sort of cycle and
repeat.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.480
And this is reflected in you
know the combined market

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.780
capitalization of the
airline industries maybe

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.400
something of the U.S.
airline industry.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.760
Something like a quarter
that of Google.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.400
So, you have a search engine
much,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.880
much smaller than air travel
but much more valuable and

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.740
I think this reflects these
very different valuations on

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.370
X and Y.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.070
So, you know, if we look at
perfect competition.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.570
You know there are, sort of,
there&#39;s some pros and

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.270
cons to the world of perfect
competition.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.550
On a high level it&#39;s always,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.720
this is what you study in
Econ One.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.010
It&#39;s always, it&#39;s easy to
model, which I think is why

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.060
Econ professors like talking
about perfect competition.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.290
It somehow is efficient,
especially,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.290
in a world where things are
static because you have all

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.990
the consumer surplus gets
captured by everybody.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.810
And politically, it&#39;s what
we&#39;re told is good in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.260
our society, that you want
to have competition and

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.950
this is somehow a good
thing.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.710
Of course, there are a lot
of negatives.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.870
It&#39;s generally not that good
if you&#39;re.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.095
You&#39;re involvement in
anything that&#39;s

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.280
hyper-competitive because
you often don&#39;t

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.700
make money off, come back to
this a little bit later.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.960
So, I think at one end of
the spectrum you have

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.490
industries that are
perfectly competitive.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.330
And at the other end of the
spectrum you have

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.950
things that, I would say,
are monopolies.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.910
And they&#39;re much stable,
longer term businesses,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.010
you have more capital.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.700
And if you get a creative
monopoly for

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.800
inventing something new, I
think it&#39;s symptomatic of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.060
having created something
really valuable.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.370
And so I do think this, the
extreme binary view of

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.110
the world I always
articulate is that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.930
there are exactly two kinds
of businesses in this world.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.870
There are businesses that
are perfectly competitive

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.380
and there are businesses
that are monopolies.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.200
And, there&#39;s shockingly
little that is in between.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.260
And this dichotomy is not
understood very

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.670
well because people are
constantly lying

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.190
about the nature of the
businesses they&#39;re in.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.750
And this is why,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.750
this is in my mind, this is
the most important.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.070
It&#39;s not necessarily the
most important thing in

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.060
business, but I think it&#39;s
the most

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.000
important business idea that
people don&#39;t understand.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.520
That there are just these
two kinds of businesses.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.130
And so let me

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.356
say a little bit about the
lies that people tell.

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:42.420
And so you basically, the
basic, if you sort of

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.680
imagine that there was a
spectrum of companies from

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.190
perfect competition to
monopoly.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.570
The apparent differences are
quite small.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.680
Because the people who have
monopolies pretend not to.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.470
They will basically say, and
it&#39;s because you

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.280
don&#39;t want to get regulated
by the government, you

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.480
don&#39;t want the government to
come after you.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.520
So you will never say that
you have a monopoly.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.330
So, anyone who has a
monopoly will pretend that

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.040
they&#39;re in incredible
competition.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.110
And on the other end of the
spectrum, if you

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.210
are incredibly competitive,
and if you&#39;re in some sort

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.720
of business will you will
never make any money.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.380
You will be tempted to tell
a lie that goes in

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.130
the other direction.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.120
Where you will say that
you&#39;re doing something

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.980
unique that is somehow less
competitive than it looks.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.400
Because you will want to
differentiate, you

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.300
will want to track capital
or something like that.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.760
So, if the monopolists
pretend not to have

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.700
a monopolies the
non-monopolists pretend to

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.850
have monopolies.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.960
The apparent difference is
very small.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.000
Where as the real difference
I would submit is

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.800
actually quite big.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.190
And so there&#39;s this
distortion that happens

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.660
because of the lies people
tell about their businesses.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.830
And the lies are sort of in
these opposite directions.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.160
Let me, drill a little bit
down further on the way

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.238
these lies work.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:04.121
And so

00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:08.630
the basic lie you tell as

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.590
a non-monopoly is that we&#39;re
in a very small market.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.570
The basic lie you tell as a
monopoly is

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.169
that the market you&#39;re in is
much bigger than it looks.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.770
And so typically,

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.310
if you want to think this in
sort of set theoretic terms.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.580
You could say that a
monopoly tells a why,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.670
where you describe your
business as the union of

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.430
these vastly different
markets, and

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.132
the non-monopolies describes
it as the intersection.

00:07:36.132 --> 00:07:42.030
So, that in effect, if
you&#39;re non-monopolist, you

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.510
will rhetorically describe
your market as super small.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.660
You&#39;re the only person in
that market.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.540
If you have monopoly, you&#39;ll
describe it as super big,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.550
and there&#39;s lots of
competition in it.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.930
So some examples of how this
works in practice.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.470
So I always use restaurants
as the example of

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.460
a terrible business.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.780
And there&#39;s always, sort of,
ideas that,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.370
you know, capitalism and
competition are antonyms.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.150
Capital, someone who
accumulates capital.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.450
World of perfect competition
is

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.000
a world where all the
capital gets competed away.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.430
So, you&#39;re opening a
restaurant business.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.670
No one wants to invest
because you just lose money.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:20.280
So you have to tell some
idiosyncratic narrative.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.100
And you will say something
like, well,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.780
we&#39;re the only British food
restaurant in Paolo Alto.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.460
So, it&#39;s British, Paolo
Alto.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.310
And of course,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.000
that&#39;s too small a market
because people may be able

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.220
to drive all the way to
Mountain View or even Park.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.800
And there probably no people
who eat nothing but

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.440
British food.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.080
At least, no people are
still alive.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.090
And so that is sort of a
fictitiously narrow market.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.130
There&#39;s sort of a Hollywood
version of this where.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.560
The way movies always get
pitched is, it&#39;s like

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.570
a college football star,
joins an elite group of

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.840
hackers to catch the shark
that killed his friends.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.960
So, that is a movie that has
not been made.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.280
But the question is,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.680
is that the right category
or is the correct category?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.380
It&#39;s just another movie, in
which case, you know,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.570
there are lots of those,
it&#39;s super competitive,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.170
incredibly had to make
money.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.690
No one ever makes money in
Hollywood doing movies.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.570
It&#39;s really hard.

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:32.940
And so you always have this
question about.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.410
Does the intersection, does,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.290
is it real, does it make
sense,

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.940
does it have value that one
should ask?

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.210
And of course, there are
start up versions of this.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.210
Where you, and the sort of
the really bad versions you

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.620
just take a whole series of
buzz words.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.170
Sharing, mobile, social,
apps, you combine them,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.270
and you have some kind of
narrative.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.640
And, whether or not, that&#39;s
a real business or not,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.860
is, it&#39;s generally a bad
sign.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.120
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s almost this
pattern recognition when you

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.070
have this rhetoric of this

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:04.760
sort of intersections, it
generally does not work.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.350
The something of

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.680
somewhere is really mostly
just the nothing of nowhere.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.310
It&#39;s like the Stanford of
North Dakota.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.960
One of a kind, but it&#39;s not
Stanford.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.800
So, let&#39;s look at the
opposite.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.451
The opposite lie, is if you
are, let&#39;s say,

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:26.140
the search, company, that&#39;s
down the street from here.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.040
And has about a happy 66%
market share and, you know?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.100
Is completely dominant in
the search market.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.000
Google has not almost never
describes itself.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.310
As a search engine, these
days.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.180
And instead, it describes
itself in all these

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:44.760
different ways.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.590
So, it sometimes says it&#39;s
an advertising company.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.570
So, if it was search, you&#39;d
say, well, it&#39;s, like, it

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.420
has this huge market share
that&#39;s really, really crazy.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.310
It&#39;s like a incredible
monopoly.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.010
It&#39;s much bigger than, it&#39;s
much,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.140
much more robust monopoly
than Microsoft,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.380
ever had in the 90s.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.510
Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s making
so much money.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.010
But if you say it&#39;s an
advertising market,

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:06.930
you could say,

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.590
well, there&#39;s search
advertising is 17 billion.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.490
And that&#39;s part of online
advertising,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.450
which is much bigger.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.000
And then, all US advertising
is bigger.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.330
And then by the time you get
to global advertising,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.300
that&#39;s close to 500 billion.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.322
And so you&#39;re talking about
3.5%.

00:11:26.322 --> 00:11:30.810
So a tiny part of this much
larger market.

00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:35.150
Or if you don&#39;t want it to
be an advertising company

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.930
you could always say that
you&#39;re a technology company.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:43.250
And so sorry.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.622
Let me just see.

00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:48.660
And so

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.780
the technology market is
something like a $1 trillion

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.690
market, and the narrative
that you tell is that Google

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.430
in the technology market is
well we&#39;re competing with

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.160
all the car companies with
our self-driving cars,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.470
we&#39;re competing with Apple
on TVs and iPhones.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.010
We&#39;re competing with
Facebook.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.760
We&#39;re competing with
Microsoft on office

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.200
products, we&#39;re competing
with Amazon on cloud

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.490
services, and so, we are in
this giant technology market

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.090
where there&#39;s competition in
every direction you look.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.880
And no we&#39;re

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.180
not the monopoly the
government&#39;s looking for and

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.830
we should not get regulated
in any way whatsoever.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.870
And so I think one has to
always be super aware that

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.280
there are these very
powerful incentives

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.290
to distort the nature of
these markets

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.380
one way or the other.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.920
So, the evidence of the
narrow markets in

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.490
the tech industry is if you
basically just.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.320
If you look at sort of the,
some of the big

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.370
tech companies, Apple,
Google, Microsoft,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.720
Amazon, they just they&#39;ve
just been building up

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.860
cash for year after year and
you have these incredibly

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.250
high profit margins and I
would, I would say that the.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.900
That one of the reasons the
tech industry in the US.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.220
Has been so successful
financially.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.300
Is because it&#39;s prone to
creating all these monopoly

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.170
like business.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.040
And that&#39;s and

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.070
it&#39;s reflected by these
companies.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.890
Just accumulate so much
cash.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.330
That they don&#39;t know what to
do with it

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.308
beyond a certain point.

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:28.490
And so let me

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:33.200
say a few things about how
to build a monopoly.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.767
And, I think one of the sort
of very counter

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:42.420
intuitive ideas that comes
out of this monopoly thread.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.290
Is that you want to go after
small markets.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.170
If you&#39;re a startup.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.670
You want to get to monopoly.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.040
You&#39;re starting a new
company,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.150
you want to get to monopoly.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.910
Monopolies you have a large
share of a market,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.710
how do you get to a large
share of a market?

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.190
You start with a really
small market and

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.720
you take over that whole
market, and then.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.070
And then over time you find
ways to expand that market

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.080
in concentric circles.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.190
And the thing that&#39;s always
a big mistake is going

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.730
after a giant market on day
one.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.800
Because that&#39;s typically
evidence that you

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.650
somehow haven&#39;t defined the
categories correctly.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.790
And it normally means that
there is going to be

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.260
too much competition.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.490
In one way or another.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.340
And so I think almost all
the successful companies

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.620
in Silicon Valley had some
model of

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.760
starting with small markets
and expanding.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.740
And if you take Amazon, you
start with.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.870
Just a bookstore.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.450
We have all the books in the
world.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.580
So it&#39;s a better bookstore
than anybody else

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.360
has in the world.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.130
When it&#39;s starts in the
90&#39;s, it&#39;s online,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.130
there&#39;s things you can do
you can&#39;t do before.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.145
And then you gradually
expand into all sorts of

00:14:57.145 --> 00:14:59.465
different forms of
e-commerce and

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:01.252
other things beyond that.

00:15:01.252 --> 00:15:04.816
You know, eBay you start
with Pez dispensers.

00:15:04.816 --> 00:15:06.986
You move on to Beanie Babies
and

00:15:06.986 --> 00:15:10.574
eventually it&#39;s all these
different auctions for

00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:13.740
all these sorts of different
goods.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.810
And what was very counter
intuitive about many of

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.700
these companies is they
often start with

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.560
markets that are so small
that people don&#39;t think

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.020
that they&#39;re valuable at all
when you get started.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:34.370
The PayPal version of this
was, we started with

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.730
power sellers on eBay which
was about 20,000 people.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.480
When we first saw this
happening in December of 99,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.250
January of 2000 right after
we launched,

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.130
there was a sense that these
were all,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.610
it was such a small market
it was terrible.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.860
We thought these were
terrible customers to have.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.010
It&#39;s just people selling
junk on the internet.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.960
Why in the world do we want
to

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.800
be going after this market?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.920
But, you know, there was a
way to get a product that

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.040
was much better for
everybody in that market.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.060
You could, and we got to
something like 25, 30%,

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.510
you know, market penetration
in two or three months.

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.700
And you got some walk in.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.130
You got brand recognition
and

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.300
your able to build the
business from there.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.850
So I always think these,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.220
these very small markets are
quite underrated.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.550
The Facebook version of this
I always give is that you

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.700
know if the initial market
of

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.150
Facebook was 10,000 people
at Harvard, it went from

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.910
zero to sixty percent market
share in ten days.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.020
That was a very auspicious
start.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.246
The way this gets analyzed
in business schools is

00:16:34.246 --> 00:16:35.711
always, that&#39;s ridiculous,

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:38.330
it&#39;s such a small market it
can&#39;t have any value at all.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.230
And so, I think the business
school analysis of

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.900
Facebook early on, or of
PayPal early on, or

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.240
of eBay early on is that the
markets were perhaps, so

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.820
small as to have, almost no
value.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.620
And they, they would have
had little value had

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.450
they stayed small, but it
turned out they were ways to

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.230
grow them concentrically
and, that&#39;s what made them,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.260
that&#39;s what made them so
valuable.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.730
Now I think the opposite
version of this,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.890
is always where you have
super big markets.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.910
And, and I, there&#39;s so much,

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.650
so many different things
that went wrong with all

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.670
the clean tech companies in
the last decade.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.740
But, but, one,

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.620
one theme that ran through
almost all of them,

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.070
was that they all started
with massive markets.

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.850
And every clean tech
PowerPoint presentation that

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.900
one saw in the years 2005 to
2008,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.830
which was the clean tech
bubble in Silicon Valley.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.330
Started with, we&#39;re in the
energy market,

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.070
we&#39;re in a market that&#39;s
measured in hundreds of

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.510
billions of trillions of
dollars.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:42.180
And then once you&#39;re a
minnow in a vast ocean.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.860
That&#39;s not a good place to
be.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.440
That means that you have
tons of competitors and

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.080
you don&#39;t even know who all
the competitors are.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.930
And so you want to be a one
of a kind company,

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.740
where it&#39;s the only one in a
small ecosystem.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.300
You don&#39;t want to

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.750
be the fourth online pet
food company.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.330
You don&#39;t want to be

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.780
the tenth thin film solar
panel company.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.322
You don&#39;t want to be the
100th restaurant in

00:18:03.322 --> 00:18:04.300
Palo Alto.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.550
Your restaurant industry is
a trillion dollar industry,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.140
so if you do a market size
analysis you conclude

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.730
restaurants are a fantastic
business to go into, and

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.580
it&#39;s often, large markets,
large existing markets

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.180
typically mean that you have
tons of competition, very,

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.160
very hard to differentiate.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.780
So the first very
counterintuitive into a idea

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.000
is to go after small
markets, often markets that

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.380
are so small people don&#39;t
even notice them.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.200
They don&#39;t think that they
make sense.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.900
That&#39;s where you got a
foothold, and

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.380
then if those markets are
able to expand,

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.740
you can scale into a big
monopoly business.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.260
You know, a second sort of,
the sort of several

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.890
different characteristics of
these monopoly businesses,

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.480
that I like to focus on.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.670
There&#39;s probably no sort of
single formula to it.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.130
I also ways think that that
in technology there

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.470
is always a sense that you
know,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.800
the history of technology is
such that every.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.670
Every moment happens only
once, so you know the next

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.110
Mark Zuckerberg won&#39;t build
a social network.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.800
The next Larry Page won&#39;t be
building a search engine.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.080
The next Bill Gates won&#39;t be

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.750
building an operating
system.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.402
And if you&#39;re copying these
people,

00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:18.450
you&#39;re not learning from
them.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:19.950
But it&#39;s, and so,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:23.600
there is always these very
unique businesses that

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.930
are doing something that&#39;s
not been done before,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.320
end up, end of having the
potential to be a monopoly.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.330
The opening line in Anna
Karenina that all

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.770
happy companies, sorry, all
happy families.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.760
All happy families are
alike.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.490
All unhappy families are
unhappy in

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.000
their own special way.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.550
And the opposite is true in
business,

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.180
where I think all happy
companies are different

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.510
because they&#39;re doing
something very unique.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.470
All unhappy companies are
alike because they fail to

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.330
escape the essential
sameness that

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.100
is competition, and so

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.410
one sort of characteristic
of a monopoly technology

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.500
company is some sort of
proprietary technology.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.680
My sort of crazy, somewhat
arbitrary,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.940
rule of thumb is you want to
have a technology that&#39;s

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.210
an order of magnitude better
than the next best thing.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.460
So Amazon had over ten times
as many books,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.300
maybe not that high tech,
but you figure out a way to

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.030
sell ten times as many books
in an efficient online way.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.630
You know, PayPal, the
alternative for

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:29.160
PayPal was using checks to
send money on eBay,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.590
took seven to ten days to
clear.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.560
PayPal could do it more than
ten times as fast.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.770
So you wanna have some sort
of very

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:41.360
powerful improvement in some
order, maybe an order of

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.150
magnitude improvement on
some key dimension.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.940
Of course, you know,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.030
if you actually come with
something totally new it&#39;s,

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.200
it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just like an
infinite improvement.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.990
So I would say the,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.820
the iPhone was the first
smartphone that worked and

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.530
so that&#39;s, you know that&#39;s
like I mean,

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.690
I mean maybe not infinite,
but

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.150
it&#39;s sort of definitely
order of magnitude or

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:01.190
more of improvement.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:05.030
So I think, the, the
technology is designed to

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.880
give you a massive delta
over, over the next,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.950
the next best thing.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.580
I think, I think there often
are network effects that

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.820
can kick in that, really
help.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.430
The thing that&#39;s very, and
these,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.720
these lead to monopolies
over time,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.800
the thing that&#39;s very tricky
about network effects is,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.740
they&#39;re often.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.440
They&#39;re often very hard to
get started.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.370
So even though everyone
understands how

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.880
valuable they are, there is

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.400
always this incredibly
tricky question why is it

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.660
valuable to the first person
who is doing something?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.860
Economies of scale, if you
have something of

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.720
a very high fixed costs,
very low marginal cost.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.520
That&#39;s typically a monopoly
like business.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.110
And then there&#39;s this thing
of branding.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.220
Which is sort of like this
idea that gets lodged in

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.420
people&#39;s brains.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.700
I never quite understand how
branding works, so I never

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.920
invest in companies where
it&#39;s just about branding.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.670
But it is, I think,

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.320
a real phenomenon that
creates real value.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.330
I think one of the things,
I&#39;m gonna come back to

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.990
this a little bit, towards
the end.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.410
But one of the things that&#39;s
very striking,

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.190
is that software businesses
are often, are, for

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.980
some reason, very good at
some of these things.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.660
They&#39;re especially good at
the economies of scale part.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.290
Because, the marginal cost
of software is zero.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.860
And so if you get something
that works in software.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.080
It&#39;s often significantly
better

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.350
than the existing solution.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.210
And then you have these
tremendous economies of

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.500
scale, and you can scale
fairly quickly.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.640
So even if the market starts
small,

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.940
you can grow your business
quickly enough to stay at

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.350
the same size as the growing
market.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.190
And maintain the sort of
monopoly power.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.880
Now, the critical thing
about these monopolies is,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:56.370
it&#39;s not enough to have a
monopoly for just a moment.

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.320
The critical thing is to

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.130
have one that lasts over
time.

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.120
And so in Silicon Valley
there&#39;s always this idea

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120
that you wanna be the first
mover.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.260
And I, I always think it&#39;s,
it&#39;s, in some ways,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.670
the better framing is you
wanna be the last mover, or

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.000
you wanna be the last
company in a category.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.430
Those are the ones that are
really valid.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.760
Microsoft was the last
operating system,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.430
at least for many decades.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.650
Google is the last search
engine.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.140
Facebook will be valuable if
it turns out to be the last,

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.010
social networking site.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.760
One way to think of

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.950
this last mover of value is
this idea that most of

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.890
the value in these companies
exists far in the future.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.770
If you do a discounted cash
flow analysis of a business.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.160
You look at, you have sort
of all these profit streams.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.360
You have a growth rate.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.640
The growth rate&#39;s much
higher than

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.880
the discount rate.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.900
And so most of the value
exists far in the future.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.783
I did this exercise At
PayPal in March of 2001.

00:23:52.783 --> 00:23:55.110
We&#39;d been in business for
about 27 months.

00:23:56.345 --> 00:24:00.660
And we sort of had, the
growth rate was 100% a year.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.890
We were discounting future
cashflows by about 30%.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.460
And it turned out that about
three quarters of

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.310
the value of the business,
as of 2001,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.180
came from cash flows in
years 2011 and beyond.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.260
And whenever you do the math
on any of these tech

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.840
companies, you get an answer
that&#39;s something like that.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.020
So if you are trying to
analyze any other

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.170
tech companies in Silicon
Valley, Arabian B, Twitter.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.390
Facebook, any emerging
internet companies,

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.570
any of the ones in
Y-Combinator.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.215
The math tells you that
three quarters, 80,

00:24:33.215 --> 00:24:36.620
85% of the value is coming
from cash flows in

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.780
years 2024 and beyond.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.910
It&#39;s very, very far in the
future.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.010
And, so one of the things
that we always overvalue in

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:46.570
Silicon Valley is growth
rates, and

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.730
we undervalue durability.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.300
Because, growth is something
you can measure in the here

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.040
and now, and you can always
track that very precisely.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.240
The question of whether a
company&#39;s still gonna be

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.070
around a decade from now.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.300
That&#39;s actually what,

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.520
what dominates the value
equation and

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.510
that sort of is a much more
qualitative sort of a thing.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.570
And so if we, if we went
back to this idea of these

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.700
characteristics of monopoly,
proprietary technology,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.360
network effects, economies
of scale, You can think

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.270
of these characteristics as
ones that exist at a moment

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.190
in time when you capture a
market and take it over.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.880
But you also want to think
about,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.370
are these things going to
last over time.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.350
And, so, there&#39;s a time

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.440
dimension to all these
characteristics.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.030
So, net worth effects also
have a great time element,

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.010
where as the network scales
the network

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.750
effects actually get more
robust, and so

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.430
if you have a network effect
business that&#39;s often one

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:46.120
that can become a bigger and
stronger monopoly over time.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.710
Proprietary technology is
always a little bit of

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.520
a tricky one, so

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.180
you want something that&#39;s
order magnitude better.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.620
Than, the state of the art
in the world today.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.890
And that&#39;s how you get
people&#39;s attention.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.900
That&#39;s how you initially
break through.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.960
But then, you don&#39;t wanna be
superseded by somebody else.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.580
And so there are all these
areas of innovation where,

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.500
there was tremendous
innovation, but

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.650
no one made any money.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.310
So, you know?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.360
Describe manufacturing in
the 1980&#39;s.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.340
You could im-,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.410
you could do a better disk,

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.500
build a better disk drive
than anybody else.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.260
You could take over the
whole world.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.960
And two years later someone
else would come along and

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.070
replace yours.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.810
And the course of 15 years,

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.520
you got vastly improved disk
drives, so

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.760
it had great benefit to
consumers, but it didn&#39;t

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.140
actually help the people who
started these companies.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.590
And so there&#39;s always this
question about having a huge

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.640
breakthrough in technology,
but then also being able to

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.490
say, explain why, yours will
be the last breakthrough, or

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.660
at least the last
breakthrough for

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.960
a long time, or when you
make a breakthrough.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.110
And then you can keep
improving on it

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.790
at a quick enough pace that
no one can ever catch up.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.620
So, if you have a structure
of structure of

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.530
the future where there&#39;s a
lot of innovation and

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.690
other people will come up
with new things in

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.430
the thing you&#39;re working on.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.050
That&#39;s great for society.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.090
It&#39;s actually not that good
for

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.600
your business, typically.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.560
And then economies of scale,
we&#39;ve already talked about.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.070
So I think this last mover
thing is very critical.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.520
I&#39;m always, you know,

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.200
I don&#39;t wanna overdo the
chess analogies, but

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.350
the first mover in chess is
someone who plays white.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.860
White is about a 1/3 of a
pawn advantage, so

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.370
there&#39;s a small advantage to
going first.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.980
You wanna be the last mover,
who wins the game, so

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.911
there&#39;s always the,
Capablanca world champion,

00:27:33.911 --> 00:27:38.670
Capablanca must begin by
studying the end game, and

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.440
I do think that&#39;s, while I
wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s the only

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.550
thing you should study.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.870
I think the sort of
perspective of

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.330
asking these questions, why
will this still be

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.230
the leading company 10, 15,
20 years from now, is a,

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.598
is a really critical one to
try to think through.

00:27:52.598 --> 00:27:56.920
Let me, let me sort of,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.810
I want to sort of go in two
slightly other directions

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:02.930
with this monopoly vs
competition idea.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:08.170
And I think so I think this
is the, the central idea,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.210
in my mind for, for business
for starting business for

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.850
thinking about them and
there are some, interesting

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.960
perspectives I think it
gives on the whole you know,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.050
on the whole history of
innovation and

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.540
technology and science.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:27.040
Because, yeah we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve
lived through,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.490
250, 300 years of incredible
technological progress in

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.170
you know many, many
different domains.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.670
You know, steam engine to
railways to

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.040
telephones, refrigeration,
household appliances,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.750
you know the computer
revolution, aviation.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.230
All sorts of different areas
of

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.680
technological innovation and
then there&#39;s sort of

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.170
analogous thing that one can
say about science,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.630
where we&#39;ve lived through
centuries of enormous

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.150
amounts of innovation in
science as well.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.990
And the thing that I think
people always miss when

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.860
they think about these
things is that because X and

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.580
Y are independent variables,
some of these things can be

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.520
extremely valuable
innovations.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.200
But the people who invent
them,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.360
who come up with them, do
not get rewarded for this.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.130
And certainly, you can go
back to, you need to

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.650
create X dollars in value,
you create Y percent of X.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.750
I would suggest that the
history of science has

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.420
generally been one where Y
is 0% across the board.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.720
The scientists never make
any money.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.310
They&#39;re always deluded into
thinking that they live in

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.680
a just universe that will
reward them for

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.820
their work and for their
inventions.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.530
And this is probably the
fundamental delusion that

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:49.190
scientists tend to suffer
from in our society.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.116
And even in technology,
there are, sort of,

00:29:52.116 --> 00:29:54.518
many different areas of
technology,

00:29:54.518 --> 00:29:57.594
where there were great
innovations that created

00:29:57.594 --> 00:29:59.632
tremendous value for
society.

00:29:59.632 --> 00:30:04.499
But the people did not
actually capture that much

00:30:04.499 --> 00:30:05.928
of the value.

00:30:05.928 --> 00:30:10.761
And so I think there is a
sort of whole history of.

00:30:10.761 --> 00:30:11.491
Science and

00:30:11.491 --> 00:30:14.632
technology that can be told
from the perspective of

00:30:14.632 --> 00:30:17.050
how much value was actually
captured.

00:30:18.105 --> 00:30:22.020
And certainly, there are
entire sectors where

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.800
people didn&#39;t capture
anything.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.550
So you&#39;re the smartest
Physicist of the 20th

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.860
century, you come up with
special relativity,

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.290
you come up with general
relativity.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.010
You don&#39;t get to be a
billionaire,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.460
you don&#39;t even get to be a
millionaire.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.640
It somehow doesn&#39;t work that
way.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.640
The railroads, incredibly
valuable.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.928
Most of them just went
bankrupt,

00:30:40.928 --> 00:30:42.539
because there was too much
competition.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.290
Wright brothers, you fly the
first plane,

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.490
you don&#39;t make any money.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.120
And so I think there is sort
of a structure to

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.150
these industries, that&#39;s
very important.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.011
And I think the thing that&#39;s
actually rare,

00:30:56.011 --> 00:30:58.050
are the success cases.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.366
Most the, so it&#39;s actually
unique when you really think

00:31:00.366 --> 00:31:02.584
about the history in this,
in this 250 year sweep,

00:31:02.584 --> 00:31:04.650
it&#39;s unusual, Y is almost
always zero percent.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.390
It&#39;s always zero in science.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.360
It&#39;s almost always in
technology, and

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.980
so it&#39;s very rare where
people made money.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.710
You know, the early,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.870
the late 18th, early 19th
century, the first

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.240
industrial revolution was
textile mills, steam engine,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.780
the sort of automated
things.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.490
And you had these relentless
improvements,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.380
that people improved
efficiency of

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.470
textile factories,
manufacturing generally.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.090
At a clip of 5 to 7% every
year.

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.000
Year after year, decade
after decade.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.580
You had 60, 70 years of

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.434
tremendous improvement from
1780 to 1850.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.170
But even in 1850, most of
the wealth in Britain

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.140
was still held by the landed
aristocracy.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.195
The workers didn&#39;t, you
know,

00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.364
the workers didn&#39;t make that
much,

00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:48.920
the capitalists didn&#39;t make
that much either.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.820
It was all competed away.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.910
There were hundreds of

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.220
people running textiles
factories.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.675
It was an industry that
just,

00:31:54.675 --> 00:31:58.050
the structure of the
competition prevented people

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:59.370
from making any money.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.740
And so I think there are, in
my mind,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.180
there probably are only two
broad categories in

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.750
the entire history, the last
250 years,

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.870
where people have actually
come up with new things, and

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.438
made money doing so.

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:16.580
One is these sort of
vertically integrated

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.940
complex monopolies which
people did build in

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.100
the second industrial
revolution at the end of

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.440
the 19th and started the
20th century.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.770
And so this was like Ford,
it was the vertically

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.190
integrated oil companies
like Standard Oil.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.066
And what these vertically
integrated monopolies

00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:35.690
typically required was this
very complex coordination.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.560
You&#39;ve got a lot of pieces
to fit together in

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.280
just the right way, when you
assembled it,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.190
you had a tremendous
advantage.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:45.000
This is actually done
surprisingly little today.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.030
And so I think this is sort
of a business form that

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.930
when people can pull it off
is very valuable.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.560
It&#39;s typically fairly
capital intensive.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.885
We live sort of in a, in a
culture where is very hard

00:32:57.885 --> 00:33:01.055
to get people to buy into
anything that&#39;s super

00:33:01.055 --> 00:33:04.520
complicated, and it takes
very long to build.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.594
But I, you know,

00:33:05.594 --> 00:33:08.464
when I sort of think about
my colleague Elon Musk

00:33:08.464 --> 00:33:11.549
from PayPal success with
Tesla and Space X, I think

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:14.779
the key to these companies
was the complex vertically

00:33:14.779 --> 00:33:17.700
integrated monopoly
structure they had.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.302
So if you sort of look at
Tesla or Space X you ask,

00:33:20.302 --> 00:33:23.430
you know, was there sort of
single breakthrough?

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.190
They certainly innovated on
a lot of dimensions.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.800
I don&#39;t think there was

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.110
a single tennex breakthrough
and battery storage,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.400
or you know, maybe working
on some things in rocketry.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.145
But they hadn&#39;t,

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:37.330
there was no sort of single
massive breakthrough, but

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.290
what was really impressive
was integrating all these

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.390
pieces together, and doing
it in a way that was more

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.640
vertically integrated than
most of their competitors.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.590
So, Tesla,

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.560
you also integrated the car
distributors, so

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.280
they wouldn&#39;t steal all the
money, as has happened with

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.186
the rest of the car industry
in the US.

00:33:53.186 --> 00:33:56.450
Or SpaceX, you basically
pulled in

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:01.000
all the subcontractors where
most of the large aerospace

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.020
companies have single source
subcontractors that are able

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.940
to sort of charge monopoly
profits, and

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.200
make it very hard for

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.600
the integrated aerospace
companies to make money.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.040
And so vertical integration
I think is sort of a very

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.721
under explored modality of
technological progress,

00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:20.530
that people would do well to
look at more.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.756
And then I think there is,
there is something about

00:34:23.756 --> 00:34:27.790
software itself that&#39;s very,
very powerful.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.870
Software has these
incredible economies of

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.990
scale, these low marginal
costs and there is something

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.460
about the world of bits, as
opposed to the world of

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.350
adams, where you can often
get very fast adoption.

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:41.680
And, and the fast adoption
is critical to capturing and

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.670
taking over markets because
even if you

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:46.510
have a small market if the
adoption rate is too slow,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.050
there&#39;ll be enough time for
other people to

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.220
enter that market, and
compete with you.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:53.110
Whereas if you have a small
to mid size market, and

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.540
have a fast adoption rate.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.090
You cannot take over this
market.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.630
And so I think this is

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.490
one of the reasons Silicon
Valley has done so well, and

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.820
why software has been this
phenomenal industry.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.480
And what I, what I would
suggest, what I would want

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.780
to leave you with is there
are sort of these different

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.450
rationalizations people give
for why certain things work,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.100
and why certain things don&#39;t
work.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.020
And I think these
rationalizations always

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.960
obscure this question of
creating X dollars in value,

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.020
and capturing Y percent of
X.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.890
So the science
rationalization we&#39;re

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.290
always told, is that

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.420
the scientists aren&#39;t
interested in making money.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.060
They&#39;re doing it for

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.060
charitable reasons, and that
you&#39;re not

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.360
a good scientist if you&#39;re
motivated by money.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.850
And I&#39;m not even saying
people should

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.880
always be motivated by money
or something like this.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.420
But I think we should be a
little more critical of this

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.430
as a rationalization.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.710
We should ask, is this a
rationalization

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.730
to obscure the fact that Y
equals zero percent.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.750
And the scientists are
operating in this sort of

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.865
world where all the
innovation is

00:35:53.865 --> 00:35:55.979
effectively competed away,
and

00:35:55.979 --> 00:35:59.190
they can&#39;t capture any of it
directly.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.720
The software distortion that
often happens,

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.130
is because people are making
such a vast fortunes in

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:07.740
software, we infer that this
is the most

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.400
valuable thing in the world
being done full stop.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.830
And so if people at Twitter
make billions of dollars,

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:18.120
it must be that Twitter is
worth far more than anything

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.120
that Einstein did.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.800
What that sort of
rationalization tends to

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.090
obscure, is again that X and
Y are independent variables.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.630
And there are these
businesses where you

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.250
capture a lot of X and there
others where you don&#39;t.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.694
And so, I do think the
history of innovation has

00:36:33.694 --> 00:36:37.053
been this history where the
microeconomics,

00:36:37.053 --> 00:36:40.499
the structure of these
industries has mattered

00:36:40.499 --> 00:36:42.162
a tremendous amount.

00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:46.960
And when there is sort of
this

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.430
story where some people have
made vast fortunes, because

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.050
they were in industries with
the right structure, and

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.930
other people made nothing at
all, because they were in

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.760
these sort of very
competitive things.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.330
And we shouldn&#39;t just
rationalize that away,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.640
I think it&#39;s worth
understanding this better.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.060
And then finally, let me
come back to this

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.330
sort of overarching theme
for

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.370
this talk, this competition
is for losers idea.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.030
Which is always a
provocative way to

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.780
title things, because we
always think of

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.150
the losers as the people who
are not good at competing.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.540
We think of the losers as
the people who are slow on

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.390
the sports team, on the
track team in high school,

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.520
or who do a little bit less
well on the standardized

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.870
tests, and don&#39;t get into
the right schools.

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.220
So we always think of losers
as people who can&#39;t compete,

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.300
and I want us to really
rethink,

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.460
and revalue this and
consider whether it&#39;s

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.980
possible that competition
itself is off.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.450
That we&#39;ve sort of, it&#39;s not
just the case and

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.420
we don&#39;t understand this

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.280
monopoly competition
dichotomy intellectually.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.000
So that&#39;s, sort of,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.540
why you wouldn&#39;t understand
intellectually,

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.840
because people lie about it.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.500
It&#39;s distorted.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.730
We have all these history of
innovation

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.720
rationalizes what&#39;s
happening in all these very,

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.900
very strange ways.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.040
But I think it&#39;s more than
just an intellectual blind

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.560
spot, I think it&#39;s also a
psychological blind spot

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.370
where we find ourselves, you
know, very attracted to

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.810
competition in one form or
another.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:16.600
We find it reassuring if
other people do things.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.590
The word ape, already in the
time of Shakespeare,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.720
meant both primate and
imitate.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:21.330
And there is

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.340
something about human nature
that&#39;s deeply mimetic.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.690
Imitative.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.600
Apelike, sheeplike,
lemminglike, herdlike.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.755
And it&#39;s this very
problematic thing that we

00:38:31.755 --> 00:38:35.250
need to always think through
and try to overcome.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.653
And there is always this
question about

00:38:38.653 --> 00:38:42.280
competition as a form of
validation.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.580
Where we go for

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.220
things that lots of other
people are going for,

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:48.980
and it&#39;s not that there is
wisdom in crowds, it&#39;s

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.220
not when lots of people are
trying to do something that,

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.180
that&#39;s proof of it being
valuable.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.782
I think it&#39;s when lots of
people are trying to do

00:38:55.782 --> 00:38:58.200
something that is often
proof of insanity.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.460
There are twenty thousand
people a year who move to

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.570
Los Angeles to become movie
stars,

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.700
about 20 of them make it.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.086
I think the Olympics are a
little bit better,

00:39:07.086 --> 00:39:10.829
because you can figure out
pretty quickly whether

00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:14.748
you&#39;re good or not, so
there&#39;s a little bit less of

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:17.083
a dead weight loss to
society.

00:39:17.083 --> 00:39:18.265
You know?

00:39:18.265 --> 00:39:20.034
&gt;&gt; You the sort of
educational experience at

00:39:20.034 --> 00:39:22.317
a place, the pre Stanford
educational experience.

00:39:22.317 --> 00:39:23.332
There&#39;s always sort of

00:39:23.332 --> 00:39:25.413
a non-competitive
characterization, where I

00:39:25.413 --> 00:39:27.746
think most of the people in
this room had machine guns,

00:39:27.746 --> 00:39:30.097
that were competing with
people with bows and arrows.

00:39:30.097 --> 00:39:32.266
So it wasn&#39;t exactly a
parallel competition when

00:39:32.266 --> 00:39:35.310
you were in junior high
school and high school.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.530
There&#39;s always a question,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.725
does the tournament make
sense as you keep going?

00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:42.670
And there is always this
question if people go on to

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.930
grad school, or

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.270
post doctoral educations,
does the intensity of

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.780
the competition really make
sense?

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.360
There&#39;s the classic Henry
Kissinger line

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.680
describing his fellow
faculty at Harvard.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.620
That the battles were so

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.990
ferocious, because the
stakes were so small.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:02.570
Describing sort of academia.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.984
And you start to think on
one level this is

00:40:04.984 --> 00:40:06.690
a description of insanity.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:09.620
Why would people fight like
crazy when the stakes are so

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.500
small?

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.210
But it&#39;s also,

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:14.390
I think simply a function of
the logic of the situation.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.140
When it&#39;s really hard to
differentiate yourself from

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.970
other people.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.170
When the differences are,
when

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.690
the objective differences
really are small.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.948
Then you have to compete
ferociously to maintain

00:40:24.948 --> 00:40:26.696
a difference of one sort or

00:40:26.696 --> 00:40:30.580
another, that&#39;s often more
imaginary than real.

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.550
There&#39;s always a sort of a
personal version of

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.830
this that I tell where I was
sort of hyper tracked.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.580
My 8th grade junior high
school yearbook,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.540
one of my friends wrote in,

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.390
I know you&#39;ll get into
Stanford in four years

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.150
as a Sophomore, sort of when
it is going to Stanford four

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.530
years later, the end of high
school.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.780
Went to Stanford Law School.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.805
You know, ended up at a big
law firm in New York,

00:40:53.805 --> 00:40:57.070
where from the outside
everybody wanted to get in.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:59.380
On the inside everybody
wanted to leave.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.910
&gt;&gt; And it was this very
strange dynamic, where after

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.765
I sort of realized that this
was not the best idea,

00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:10.830
and left after seven months
and three days.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.700
You know, one of the people
down the hall from me told

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.860
me, it&#39;s really reassuring
to see you leave, Peter.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.390
I had no idea that it was
possible to

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.607
escape from Alcatraz.

00:41:18.607 --> 00:41:21.430
Which of course, all you had
to do was go out the front

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:22.900
door and not come back.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.170
But so much of people
identities got

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:29.960
wrapped in winning these
competitions,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.530
that they somehow lost site
of what was important.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.180
What was valuable.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.290
And you know, competition
does make you better

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.340
at whatever it is you&#39;re
competing on.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.405
Because when you&#39;re
competing,

00:41:39.405 --> 00:41:42.240
you&#39;re comparing yourself
with the people around you.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.060
You&#39;re figuring out,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.620
how do I beat the people
next to me?

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.560
How do I do somewhat better
at whatever it

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.880
is they&#39;re doing.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.470
And you will get better at
that thing.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.187
I&#39;m not questioning that,
I&#39;m not denying that.

00:41:52.187 --> 00:41:56.120
But, it often comes at this
tremendous price that you

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.660
stop asking some bigger
questions,

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.008
about what&#39;s truly important
and truly valuable.

00:42:01.008 --> 00:42:04.560
And so I would say, don&#39;t
always go through the tiny

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.860
little door that everyone&#39;s
trying to rush through.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.020
Maybe go around the corner,
and

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.420
go through the vast gate
that no one&#39;s taking.

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.926
Thank you very much.

00:42:11.926 --> 00:42:13.908
I guess there&#39;s time for,

00:42:13.908 --> 00:42:16.499
do you want to take a few
questions?

00:42:20.674 --> 00:42:21.463
&gt;&gt; Sorry?

00:42:23.656 --> 00:42:25.211
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, people want to
take,

00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:27.835
I&#39;ll take a few questions
with few minutes time.

00:42:27.835 --> 00:42:28.792
Yeah, go ahead.

00:42:28.792 --> 00:42:30.685
&gt;&gt; Since, yeah, as you
mentioned,

00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:33.433
you already mentioned
further competition often

00:42:33.433 --> 00:42:35.525
look similar because the
narrative of

00:42:35.525 --> 00:42:36.913
people tell our selves.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.300
Do you have any ways to

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.960
easily determine the
difference when your

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.690
looking at an idea that is
better than your own idea?

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.680
&gt;&gt; Well I&#39;d say the question
I always try to focus on is

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.960
what is the actual market?

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.650
So not what&#39;s the narrative
of the market,

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.660
because you can always tell
a fictional story about

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.810
a market that&#39;s much bigger
or much smaller.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.690
But what is the real
objective market?

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.020
So, it&#39;s always, yeah, you
always try to figure it out.

00:42:59.020 --> 00:42:59.980
And you realize people have

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.820
incentives to powerfully
distort these things.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.820
Yeah?

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.770
&gt;&gt; Which of the aspects of
monopolies that you

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:11.898
mentioned would you say
&gt;&gt; Well

00:43:11.898 --> 00:43:15.720
they have network effects
with the ad network.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.620
They had proprietary
technology that gave them

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.380
the initial lead, because
they had the page

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.760
rank algorithm which was
sort of, an order of

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.590
magnitude better than any
other search engine.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.200
You have economies of scale,

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.350
because of the need to store
all these different sites.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.320
And at this point, you have
brand, so

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.980
Google has all four.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.770
Maybe the proprietary
technology&#39;s somewhat

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:35.710
weaker at this point.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.790
But, definitely, it had all
four, and

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:38.960
maybe three out of four now.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.760
Yeah.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.980
&gt;&gt; How does this apply to
and, second, what&#39;s it like.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.445
The seconds what?

00:43:45.445 --> 00:43:46.240
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s with the i-Phone?
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.610
sort of a set of companies
that are doing

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.560
different copycat payment
systems on mobile phones.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.270
There&#39;s Square, there&#39;s
PayPal.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.200
They just have sort of
different shapes.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.700
That&#39;s how they
differentiate themselves.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.400
One is a triangle, one is a
square.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.770
And so you know...

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.250
&gt;&gt; Maybe at some point the
apes weren&#39;t out of shape or

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:05.960
something like that.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.249
But I think, pounds here we
started with focus on

00:44:09.249 --> 00:44:13.182
the intelligence community
which is small sub-market,

00:44:13.182 --> 00:44:16.072
you had a proprietary
technology that used

00:44:16.072 --> 00:44:18.710
a very different approach.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.670
Were it was focused on the
human

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.340
computer synthesis rather
than the substitution,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.620
which I think is the
dominant paradigm.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.180
So there&#39;s a whole set of
things I would say on

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.120
the market approach, and on
the proprietary technology.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:37.480
Yes?

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.712
&gt;&gt; When you have design
thinking methodology in

00:44:40.712 --> 00:44:44.710
a start-up thinking, which
is used to mitigate risk by

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.220
not creating things that
people don&#39;t want.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.436
But I think young innovators
have inspiration create

00:44:51.436 --> 00:44:54.170
complex systems that last&#39;s
through time.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:55.430
&gt;&gt; Could you repeat the
question?

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.926
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So the quest is what do I

00:44:56.926 --> 00:45:00.332
think about lean start-up&#39;s,
iterative thinking,

00:45:00.332 --> 00:45:02.578
where you get feedback from
people,

00:45:02.578 --> 00:45:04.908
versus complexity that may
not work.

00:45:04.908 --> 00:45:07.961
So, I am personally quite
skeptical of all the lean

00:45:07.961 --> 00:45:09.529
start-up methodology.

00:45:09.529 --> 00:45:13.382
I think the really great
companies did something that

00:45:13.382 --> 00:45:14.501
was, sort of.

00:45:14.501 --> 00:45:16.759
Somewhat more of a quantum
improvement that

00:45:16.759 --> 00:45:19.390
really differentiated them
from everybody else.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.790
They typically did not do
massive, you know,

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.230
customer surveys.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.600
The people who ran these
companies sometimes,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.950
not always, suffer from mild
forms of Aspberger&#39;s, so

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:31.410
they were not actually that
influenced,

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.800
not that easily deterred by
what other people thought or

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.570
told them to do.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:39.840
So I do think we&#39;re way too
focused on iteration as

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:45.720
a modality, and not enough
on trying to have a virtual

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:51.199
esp link with the public and
figuring it out ourselves.

00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:56.890
I would say that, the risk
question

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:01.160
is always a very tricky one
because there are, you know?

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.740
They&#39;re, they&#39;re, it&#39;s not,
it&#39;s often.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.010
I think it&#39;s often the case
that you

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.950
don&#39;t have enough time to
really mitigate risk.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.460
If, if you&#39;re gonna take
enough time to

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.370
figure out what people want.

00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.480
You often will have missed
the boat by then.

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:17.590
and, and then, of course,
there&#39;s always the risk of,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:21.050
of doing something that&#39;s,
that&#39;s not that,

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:22.120
significant or meaningful.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.600
So, you know?
You could say a track in

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.740
law school is a low risk
track from one

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.430
perspective, it may still be
a very high risk track in

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.040
the sense that maybe your
not, have a high risk of

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.950
not doing something
meaningful with your life.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.800
So, we have to think about
risk in these,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.980
very complicated way.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.472
I think risk is for a very
complicated concept.

00:46:42.472 --> 00:46:44.320
Yes.
I was just checking for

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.690
the last advantage, but then
doesn&#39;t that

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:47.920
imply that there&#39;s already
competition to begin with

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.040
between the chess pieces on
the chess board?

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, there&#39;s always
this terminology thing,

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:58.190
so I would say that there
are categories in

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:00.840
which people sort of are
bundled together.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.320
I would say the monopoly
businesses were in effect

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.580
they really were a big first
mover in some sense.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:09.910
You could say Google was not
the first search engine.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.062
There were other search
engines before, but

00:47:12.062 --> 00:47:12.968
on one dimension,

00:47:12.968 --> 00:47:15.515
they were dramatically
better than everybody else,

00:47:15.515 --> 00:47:17.381
they were the first one with
page rank,

00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:19.650
with sort of an automated
approach.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.890
Facebook was not the first
social networking site.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.550
My friend, Reed Hoffman,
started one in 1997,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.900
and they called it Social
Net.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.170
So they already had the
name,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:31.070
Social networking, in the
name of their company,

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.180
seven years before Facebook.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.990
Their idea was that it was
gonna be this virtual

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.440
cyberspace, where I&#39;d be a
dog and you&#39;d be a cat.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.270
And we&#39;d have all these
different rules about how

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.735
we&#39;d interact with each
other.

00:47:40.735 --> 00:47:42.310
&gt;&gt; In this virtual alternate
reality.

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.770
Facebook was the first one
to get real identity.

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.910
So, it was, so I would say,

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:49.440
I hope Facebook will be the
last social networking site,

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.780
it was the first one in a
very important dimension.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.760
People often would not think
of it as the first because

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.680
they, sort of, lump all
these things together.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.715
&gt;&gt; I have one more question.

00:47:57.715 --> 00:47:59.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, one question, let&#39;s
take one here.

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:02.390
&gt;&gt; If you&#39;re theoretically
someone who,

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:05.050
worked at Golden College and
left there after six months,

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:11.180
and is now going to do
science at Standford.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.770
How would you recommend
rethinking

00:48:16.408 --> 00:48:20.140
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t have a great,

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.650
I&#39;m not great at the
psychotherapy stuff so

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:27.020
I don&#39;t quite know how to
&gt;&gt; solve this.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.300
There are these very odd
studies they&#39;ve

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.530
done on people who go to
business school.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.680
There&#39;s one they&#39;ve done at
Harvard Business school

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.860
where it&#39;s sort of the
anti-Asperger, personality.

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.910
We have people who are super
extroverted,

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:44.290
generally have low
convictions, few ideas.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.970
And you have sort of a
hothouse environment.

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.200
You put all these people in
for two years.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.110
And at the end of it, they
systematically end up,

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.040
the largest cohort
systematically ends up

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.770
doing the wrong thing.

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.700
They tried to catch the last
wave.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.120
You know in 1989 everyone in
Harvard tried to work for

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.150
Mike Milken, it was one or

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.880
two years before he went to
jail for

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:02.150
all the junk bond stuff.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.040
They were never interested
in Silicon Valley or

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.810
tech, except for &#39;99 and
2000 when they timed the dot

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.660
com bubble peaking
perfectly.

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.890
They did, and then &#39;05 to
&#39;07 was housing.

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.770
Private equity, stuff like
this.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:18.640
I do think this tendency for

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:23.190
us to see competition as
validation is very deep.

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:26.170
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any
sort of

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:29.800
easy psychological formula
to avoid it.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.210
I don&#39;t know what sort of
therapy to recommend.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.260
&gt;&gt; But my first.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.609
My first starting point,

00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:40.061
which is only like maybe ten
percent of the way,

00:49:40.061 --> 00:49:42.740
is to never under estimate
how big a problem it is.

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.480
We always think this is

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.080
something that afflicts
other people.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:45.580
It&#39;s easy for

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.490
me to point to people in
business schools or people

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.500
at Harvard or people on Wall
Street, I think it actually

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.900
does afflict all of us to a
very profound degree.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.150
We always think of
advertising as

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.960
things that work on other
people.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.780
How, who are all these
stupid people who fall for

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.710
all those ads on tv,

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.370
they obviously work to some
extent and

00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.340
they work, to a disturbing
extant on all of us.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.210
And it&#39;s something we, we
all should work to overcome.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.460
Thank you very much.

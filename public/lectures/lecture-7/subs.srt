1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,110
All right.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,080
So when I talk about making
products users love what I

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,050
mean specifically is like
how do we make things that

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,800
has a passionate user base
that our users

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,950
are unconditionally wanting
it to

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,590
be successful both on the
products that we build, but

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,960
also the companies behind
them.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,680
We're gonna go over tons of
information.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,260
Try not to take too many
notes,

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,290
mostly just try to listen.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,750
I'll post the link to the
slides on my Twitter account

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,470
and on that link, there will
be a way for you to

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,570
annotate the slide and you
can ask me questions.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,840
And so if we don't get to
them,

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,040
I'll answer them after the
talk.

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,840
So, you guys have been.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,480
Listening to and

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,030
hearing a lot about growth
over the last several weeks,

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,050
and to me I feel like growth
is usually fairly simple.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,410
It's the interaction between
two sort of concepts or

21
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,450
variables.

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,430
Conversion rate and churn.

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,100
Right?

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,950
And the gap between those
two things pretty

25
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,920
much indicate how fast
you're gonna grow.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,190
And most people, especially
business type people,

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,290
tend to look at this
interaction in terms of

28
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,980
a very calculated in a
mathematical sort of way.

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,070
And today, I sort of want to

30
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,180
talk about these things at a
more human scale.

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,720
All right, cuz at start up
when you're interacting with

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,700
your users, you have a
fairly intimate

33
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,010
interaction that you have in
the early stages.

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,020
And so, I think there's a
different way of looking at

35
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,020
this stuff in terms of how
we build our products.

36
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,080
And we'll look at a lot of
different examples of that.

37
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,190
And how it's executed well.

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,030
My philosophy behind a lot
of things that I teach

39
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,430
startups is the best way to
sort of get to a billion

40
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,000
dollars is to focus on the
values that help you

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,870
get that first dollar, to
acquire that first user.

42
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,080
If you sort of get that
right everything else will

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,270
sort of take care of itself.

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,190
It's a sort of faith thing.

45
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,770
So I came to be a partner at
YC by way of being alumni.

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,800
I went to the program in
winter of 2006, so

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,890
it's the second ever program
and

48
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,420
I built a product called
Wufoo.

49
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,050
Wufoo's an online forum
builder.

50
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,830
It helps you create contact
forums and

51
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,170
online surveys and simple
payment forms.

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,350
It's basically a database
that looks like it's

53
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,090
designed by Fisher Price.

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,810
What's.

55
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,450
Interesting, though, is that
because it was fairly easy

56
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,290
to use, we're had customers
from every industry, market,

57
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,710
and vertical you can think
of, including a,

58
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,270
a majority of the Fortune
500 companies out there.

59
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,430
Ran the company for five
years, and

60
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,070
then we were acquired by
SurveyMonkey in 2013.

61
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,420
And at the time,

62
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,500
we were a very interesting
acquisition.

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,460
We were only a team of ten
people at the time.

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,680
And, while we acquired
funding out here in

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,820
Silicon Valley through Y
Combinator we actually ran

66
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,420
the company from Florida.

67
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,330
We had no office.

68
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,470
Everyone worked from home.

69
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,160
And we're an interesting
outlier.

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,940
So, each dot here represents
a start up that was,

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,400
that exited through IPO or
acquisition.

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,760
And we're this outlier to
the left.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,690
The bottom is the funding
amount they took.

74
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,530
And the vertical axis is,

75
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,440
the valuation of the company
at the time.

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,170
To sum it up,

77
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,685
the average startup rates as
about $25 million.

78
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:04,930
And they return to their
investors about 676%.

79
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,440
Wufoo raised about $118
thousand total.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,083
And our return to our
investors is about 29,000%.

81
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,810
>> So a lot of people were
very interested.

82
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,800
And are sort of like.

83
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,395
What makes.

84
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:17,510
Wufoo a little bit different
or

85
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,590
how do we run the company
very differently, and

86
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,910
a lot of it was focused on
product.

87
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,648
We weren't interested in
building software that,

88
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:28,910
I guess that just people
wanted to use.

89
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,070
Right.
That reminding you that you

90
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,990
worked in a cubicle,

91
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,560
cuz it was database app at
its sort of core.

92
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
We wanted a product that
people wanted to love.

93
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,600
That people wanted to have a
relationship with, and we

94
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,920
were actually very fanatical
about how we approached.

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,570
This idea.

96
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,930
At the point where it's
almost sort of

97
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,730
sort of sciency sort of way.

98
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,440
So what we said was like
Okay.

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,030
What's interesting about
start-ups in terms of

100
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,580
us wanting to create things
that people love is that,

101
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,930
love and unconditional sort
of feelings are things that

102
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,919
are difficult for us to do
in sort of real life.

103
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,580
And at start-ups we have to
do it sort of at scale.

104
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,590
So we've decided to do is

105
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,510
just start of by just
looking at, Okay,

106
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,750
how does real relationships
work in the real world, and

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,390
how can we apply them to
sort of how we

108
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,630
run our business and sort of
build our product that way.

109
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,040
So we'll go over basically
these two metaphors,

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,190
find new users as if we're
trying to date them and

111
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,520
existing users as if it were
a successful marriage.

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,460
So when it comes to dating,
lot of the stuff that

113
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,630
we uncovered had to do with
first impressions.

114
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,270
all, all of you often talk
about your relationships in

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,440
terms of the origin story.

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,950
If I asked you to tell me
about the first kiss,

117
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,760
how you sort of met, how you
proposed,

118
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,530
these are the things that we
say over and

119
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,250
over and over again.

120
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,580
They're basically the
word-of-mouth stories of our

121
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,590
relationships, and they're
the same kinds of

122
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,990
things that we do with
companies.

123
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,560
Human beings

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,260
are relationship
manufacturing creatures.

125
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,440
We cannot help, but create
and anthropomorphize

126
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,590
the things we interact with
over and over again.

127
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,200
So, whether it's the cars we
drive,

128
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,220
the clothes we wear, the
tools and software's we use,

129
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,470
we eventually prescribe
characteristics to it.

130
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,250
A personality.

131
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,570
And we expect it to behave a
certain way.

132
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,350
And that's how we sort of
interact with it.

133
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,140
Now first impressions are
important for

134
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,760
the starting of any
relationship,

135
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,420
because it's the one we tell
over and over again.

136
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,960
Right?

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,710
And there's something
special about how we

138
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,910
regard that origin story.

139
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,300
I'll give an example.

140
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,100
If you're on a first date
with somebody,

141
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,090
and you're having a nice
dinner, and

142
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,510
you catch them picking their
nose.

143
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,930
You are probably not gonna
have another date with them.

144
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,440
Right, but if you're married
to someone for

145
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,130
about 20 to 30 years,

146
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,560
and you catch on the Barca
Lounger digging for

147
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,640
gold right?

148
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,380
You don't immediately like
call your lawyer,

149
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,660
right, and then say like we
have a problem here.

150
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,310
I need to start drawing up
papers for divorce.

151
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,850
You shrug your shoulders and

152
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,510
say at least he has a heart
of gold.

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,470
So solving about.

154
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,740
First time interactions
means that the threshold is

155
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,150
so much lower in terms of
pass fail.

156
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,590
So, in software, and for

157
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,250
most products in internet
software that we use, like,

158
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,290
first impressions are pretty
obvious.

159
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,420
And they're the things that
you see a lot of

160
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,890
companies sort of pay
attention to in terms of

161
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,410
what they send their
marketing people to work on.

162
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,830
My argument for people who
are very good at product is

163
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,030
they discover so many other
first moments, and

164
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,890
they make those something
memorable.

165
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,100
Right, the first email you
ever get from a piece of

166
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,760
software.

167
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,090
What happens when you first
log in?

168
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,480
The links, the advertising,
the very first time you

169
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,730
interact with customer
support.

170
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,940
All of those are
opportunities to seduce.

171
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,890
So how did we think about.

172
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,850
Sort of like making first
moments on there,

173
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,610
and we actually took this
concept from the Japanese.

174
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,120
They actually have two words
for

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,200
how to describe things when
you're finished with them

176
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,540
in terms of saying like is
this a quality item.

177
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,396
And the two words of quality
are atarimae hinshitsu and

178
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:48,290
miryokuteki hinshitsu.

179
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,470
And the first one means,
taken for

180
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,200
granted quality, basically
functionality.

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
And the last one sort of
means,

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,550
enchanting quality, right?

183
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,750
Take for example a pen,
right?

184
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,170
Something has miryokuteki,
right, if the weight of

185
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,220
the pen, the way the ink
flows out of it, the way

186
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,960
it's viewed by the people
reading the handwriting from

187
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,020
the pen is pleasurable both
to the user of the pen and

188
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,110
the people who experience
the byproducts of it,

189
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,840
right, taking it to the sort
of next level.

190
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,150
Start with some examples.

191
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,430
So this is Wufoo's Login
link, and

192
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,280
it has a dinosaur on it,
which I think is awesome.

193
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,080
But if you hover over it,

194
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,060
the spec has the added
benefit of having a tool tip

195
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,690
that doesn't explain like
how to login or

196
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,260
what it does, but basically,
rawr.

197
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,800
And.

198
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,890
What we noticed about this,
like in early usability

199
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,280
studies as like this put a
smile on people's faces.

200
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,630
Like, hands down.

201
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,170
Right?

202
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,030
Universally.

203
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,640
And I think a lot of times
when we

204
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,530
are assessing products, we
never think about,

205
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,190
like, hey what is the
emotion on

206
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,490
the person's face when they
interact with this?

207
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,500
This is Vimeo's log in page
this is

208
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,070
actually a couple integr,
iterations ago.

209
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,540
It's one I find to be the
most beautiful, but.

210
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,200
It lets you know that when
you're starting out on

211
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,180
this journey with Vimeo,

212
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,640
that this is gonna be
something different.

213
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,170
They do this all over the
app.

214
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,810
If you search for the word
fart, as you scroll up and

215
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,190
down it makes fart noises as
you do this.

216
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,730
Right?

217
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,920
There's something different,

218
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,705
like this site interacts
with you.

219
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:16,290
>> Mm-hm.
>> It's a little bit

220
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,530
magical, it's a little bit
different.

221
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,510
And it's something that you
wanna talk about.

222
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,600
You don't have to always do
it with design.

223
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,700
This is a sign up form for

224
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,430
Cork which used to be a
social network for

225
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,700
people who loved to drink
wine.

226
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,190
On it, it says email
address,

227
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,240
it's also your sign-in and
has to be legit.

228
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,500
First name, what your mom
calls you, last name,

229
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,260
what your Army buddies call
you.

230
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,800
Password, something you'll
remember, but hard to guess,

231
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,340
password confirmation, think
it a, type it again.

232
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,560
Think of it as a test.

233
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,700
It's literally a poem as you
fill out the form.

234
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,540
Right?

235
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,690
And this is a kind of like
thing where you like,

236
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,110
oh, I like the people behind
this.

237
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,850
I, I, I'm gonna enjoy this
experience.

238
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,970
Now what does it say when
you fill out form like this?

239
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,470
Right.

240
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,960
On Yahoo, about what the
personality.

241
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,890
Of the site it's gonna be.

242
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,500
And what's disappointing to
me is like,

243
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,570
Yahoo forces every product
and

244
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,960
service under them to use
this exact same login form.

245
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,450
Flickr, I had thought,

246
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,280
had one of the best sort of
call to actions.

247
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,700
It was, get in there.

248
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,200
Right?

249
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,259
This is Heroku's.

250
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,650
Sign up page.

251
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,230
I think this is an older
version.

252
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,340
But, what's remarkable about
it is that, what you

253
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,180
start getting a feel for is
like, oh, scaling up.

254
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,000
My sort of server, and

255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,190
back end services is as easy
as sort of dragging up and

256
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,460
down, different sort of nobs
and levers.

257
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,820
It's gonna be beautifully
used, and

258
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,570
it looks fairly easy to
scale.

259
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,460
Since we're in a room full
of computer science people,

260
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,880
I think you'll appreciate
this.

261
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,660
This is Chocolat.

262
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,750
This is a code editor, and

263
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,320
they only have one call to
action.

264
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,270
When the time limit is up,
they say, everything in

265
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,050
terms of all the pieces are
exactly the same except we

266
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,600
change the font.

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
To comic sans.

268
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,540
And what they're basically
saying is like hey

269
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,932
we know who our users are,
who our real customers are.

270
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,030
They're gonna be the people
who care about this.

271
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,480
This is Hurl, this is a
website for

272
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,580
checking htp requests, and
sometimes the places where

273
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,650
you get errors are
opportunities for

274
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,527
first moments,

275
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,390
you had a four of four this
is what you get it,

276
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,040
when we need help oftentimes
what we do is where we

277
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,770
create like really beautiful
mark, marketing materials.

278
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,820
But when you actually need,
like, documentation we sort

279
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,850
of like skimp out on sort of
design features.

280
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,060
And this is a point that,
like,

281
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,830
you see happen over and over
again.

282
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,520
A company that gets this
right is MailChimp.

283
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,470
And what they did was they
redesigned all of their

284
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,350
help guides so that they
looked like magazine covers.

285
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,890
And overnight, basically,

286
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,920
readership goes up on all
these features.

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,080
And customer support for
these things that sort of

288
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,220
help people optimize emails
goes down.

289
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,400
Speaking of documentation,
stripe.

290
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,550
What's interesting about an
API company is that there is

291
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,340
no UX.

292
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,810
The UX is actually just
documentation, right?

293
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,390
And there's opportunities
even in documentation.

294
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,720
Sort of the enchant and
amaze.

295
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,660
So one of the things that I

296
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,140
love about them is their
examples are wonderful.

297
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,280
But if you're actually,
like,

298
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,830
sort of logging into the
app,

299
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,340
one of the things that is a
super pain for most people,

300
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,770
when you're dealing with
most people's APIs, is,

301
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,920
like, grabbing your API
credentials and keys.

302
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,610
And what Stripe does is it
says oh,

303
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,610
if you're logged into the
app.

304
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,390
We automatically put

305
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,110
your API credentials into
the examples, so you only

306
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,090
have to copy paste once when
trying to learn their API.

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,050
When Wufoo wanted to launch
the third version of our API

308
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,940
we realized like, Okay, that
finally this is good enough

309
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,070
that we want people to sort
of build on top of it.

310
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,040
We were trying to figure
out,

311
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,740
like, how do we launch this
out to the world,

312
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,550
that sort of has our
personality behind it.

313
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,430
Because a lot of people,

314
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,000
they usually do things like
a programming API contest,

315
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,960
and they give out iPads and
iPhones.

316
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,830
And it makes you look like
everyone else.

317
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,440
And so, in our company one
weird value to

318
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,740
have it's a quirk of us,

319
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,570
is that the co-founders are
big medieval nuts.

320
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,510
And we take everyone out to
Medieval Times every single

321
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,130
year, on the anniversary of
the founding of the company.

322
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,760
And so, we said we have to
do something in that flavor.

323
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,650
And so we contacted the guys
at armor.com,

324
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,800
we said can you forward us a
custom battle-ax.

325
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,630
And what we said was if

326
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,580
you win our programming
contest you would win one.

327
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,800
The result is like people
wanted to talk about this.

328
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,380
It's something that people
wanted to work on cuz

329
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,860
they wanted to be able to
say it like I'm programming.

330
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,420
For a weapon.

331
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:46,850
And what's cool is we had
over 25 different

332
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,790
applications created for us
of quality and quantity that

333
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,410
we could not have paid for
on the budget and

334
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,820
the sort of time that we had
for this.

335
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,150
We got things like an iPhone
app and

336
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,720
Android and WordPress
plugins, right?

337
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,850
And all because what we did
was we changed how

338
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,520
people wanna talk about the
origin story of

339
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,779
how they're interacting with
one of our services.

340
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,990
And go like all day long of
going over these examples.

341
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,000
But I'm gonna short cut this
by saying,

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,750
you should just subscribe a
little bit of details.

343
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,480
It's just basically tons of
screen shots of software

344
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,370
that's just doing it right.

345
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,160
That shows that they're
being

346
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,099
conscientious of the user
and the customers.

347
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,799
When it comes to long term
relationships or

348
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,843
marriages, the only research
that we ended up having to

349
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:37,390
read was the stuff that was
done by John Gottman.

350
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,520
He's been featured in This
American Life,

351
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,490
in Malcolm Gladwell's books.

352
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,040
He's a marriage researcher
up in Seattle.

353
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,250
And he has an interesting
parlor trick that he can do.

354
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,730
He can watch a video tape of
a couple fighting about some

355
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,320
issue for 15 minutes.

356
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,900
And predict with an 85%
accuracy rate whether that

357
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,930
couple will be together or

358
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,630
not, or divorced in four
years.

359
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,770
If he increases that video
up to an hour.

360
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,620
And asks them to also talk
about their hopes and

361
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,540
dreams.

362
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,167
That prediction rating goes
up to 94%.

363
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:06,150
They showed these same video
tapes to marriage

364
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,700
counselors, successfully
married couples,

365
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,630
sociologists, psychiatrists,
priests, et cetera and

366
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,680
they can't predict with
random chance whether people

367
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,250
are gonna be together or
not.

368
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,590
So John Gauntman understands
something fundamental about.

369
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,110
How relationships work in
the long term.

370
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,650
And that basically how we
fight, even in a short term

371
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,030
period can indicate sort of
the whole system and

372
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,140
what it's gonna look like.

373
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,900
And one of the surprising
things he discovered,

374
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,420
it's not that

375
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,430
successfully married people
don't fight at all.

376
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,430
It turns out everybody
fights.

377
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,090
And we all fight about the
exact same things money,

378
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,300
kids, sex, time and others.

379
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,263
And others are things like
jealousy and in-laws.

380
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,543
To bring this around, right,
you can actually attribute

381
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:49,543
every single one of these to
problems that you see in

382
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,931
customer support when you're
building out your products.

383
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:56,532
Right, so.

384
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,447
This costs too much.

385
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,401
I'm having problems with a
credit card.

386
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,260
If you're building a service
that helps people deal with

387
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,190
their clients they're very

388
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,480
sensitive about anything
happening with that.

389
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,530
Performance.

390
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,750
How long you're up and how
fast.

391
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,110
Others are I said jealousy
and in-laws.

392
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,960
Right, so that's competition
and partnerships.

393
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,310
So anything weird happening
there,

394
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,090
people are gonna write to
you about.

395
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,520
And the reason I like to
think about this in

396
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,430
terms of customer support is
that in every ones that

397
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,920
are processing of like a
conversion funnel,

398
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,790
customer support is the
thing that happens in

399
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,100
between every one of these
steps.

400
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,720
It's the reason why people
don't make it

401
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,650
further down there.

402
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,629
It's the thing that prevents
conversion from happening.

403
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,130
Now, as we were thinking
through all these ideas and

404
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,680
as we were building up the
company,

405
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,470
we realized that there's a
big problem about how

406
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,760
everyone sort of starts
their company or

407
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,230
build up their sort of
engineering teams.

408
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,760
And that is that there's a
broken feedback loop there.

409
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,560
People are divorced from the
consequences of

410
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,810
their actions.

411
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,580
And this is the result of
actually the natural

412
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,600
evolution of how most
companies get founded,

413
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,880
especially by technical
co-founders, right.

414
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,630
Before launch it is a time
of bliss, nirvana, and

415
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,050
opportunity, right?

416
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,470
Nothing that you do is
wrong, right?

417
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,850
By your hand, which you feel
is like god, everything that

418
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,750
you write, every line of
code feels perfect, right,

419
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,770
and is ingenious to you.

420
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,830
The thing that happens is
after launch reality sort of

421
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,030
sets in and then all these
other tasks sort of

422
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,579
come into place that we have
to deal with.

423
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,720
Now what technical
co-founders wanna do is get

424
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,240
back to that initial state
and so what we often do,

425
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,380
and what we often see is
that companies start

426
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,240
siloing off all these other
things that actually is

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,410
what makes a start up or a
company sort of real, right?

428
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,540
And have other people do
them.

429
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,590
To, in our minds, these
other tasks are inferior.

430
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,660
Right?
And we have other people in

431
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,310
the company do them.

432
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:47,580
And so for us, what we're
trying to figure out

433
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,590
is how do we change software
development so that we

434
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,970
inject some values that we
don't talk about enough?

435
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,970
Responsibility,
accountability,

436
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,780
humility, modesty.

437
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,300
Right, and we called this,
like a lot of other people,

438
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,720
we had an acronym, Support
Driven Development, and

439
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,900
it's very similar to TDD or
other agile practice.

440
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,590
It's a way of creating high
quality software, but

441
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,820
it's super simple.

442
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,182
You don't need like, a
SCRUM,

443
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,610
you don't need a bunch of
post-it notes, all you

444
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,910
have to do is make everyone
do customer support.

445
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,800
And what you end up having
is

446
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,990
you fix the feedback loop,
right?

447
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,450
The people who build the
software are the ones

448
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,240
supporting it and

449
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,940
you get all these sort of
nice benefits as a result.

450
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,340
So one of them is, support
responsible developers and

451
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,120
designers and people who
build the stuff,

452
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,600
they give the very best
support.

453
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Now we're not the first
person to think of this.

454
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Paul English was a big
proporter of this at Kayak,

455
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,750
and what he did was install
a red customer support phone

456
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,640
line in the middle of the
engineering floor.

457
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,950
And they were just regular
customer support calls.

458
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,890
And people would ask him
often times,

459
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,560
why would you pay engineers
$120,000 or

460
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,390
more to do something that
you can pay other people

461
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,890
a fraction of to handle in
like a call center?

462
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,560
And he says, well, after the
second or

463
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,930
third time that phone rings
and the engineer gets

464
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,990
the same problem they stop
what they're doing, they fix

465
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,940
the bug, and we stop getting
phone calls about it.

466
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,670
It, it's a way of having Q-A
in a sort of

467
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,840
nice elegant solution.

468
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,820
Now, John Gotman talks about
the reason that we often

469
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,600
break up with one another as
due to four major causes and

470
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,390
their warning signs.

471
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,300
He calls them the four
horsemen, right?

472
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,830
Criticism, contempt,
defensiveness,

473
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,680
and stonewalling.

474
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,590
Now, criticism is basically
people starting to focus,

475
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,350
not just on the specific
issue at hand, but

476
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,448
on the overarching issues.

477
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:45,780
Like, you never, right,
listen to your users or

478
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,480
you never think about us all
the time.

479
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,980
Right?

480
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,880
Contempt is when someone is
purposely trying to

481
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,170
insult somebody.

482
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,620
Defensiveness is not trying
to take accountability

483
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,810
trying to make excuses for
the actions.

484
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,532
And stonewalling is
basically shutting down.

485
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:07,120
Stonewalling, to John
Gotman, is, is one of

486
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,026
the worst things that we can
do in a relationship.

487
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,593
Hold up.

488
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:17,711
And oftentimes, you know, we
don't worry much about this

489
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,970
in customer se, criticism
and contempt.

490
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,770
Right?
Defensiveness,

491
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,530
you see this all the time,
all the times in companies,

492
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,790
especially as they get
older.

493
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,320
But stonewalling, this is
something I

494
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,230
see happen with start-ups
all the time.

495
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,100
You get a bunch of customer
support sort of

496
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,380
coming in and you just think
I don't need to answer it.

497
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,130
I don't need to respond.

498
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,420
Right?
And

499
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,410
that act of just not even
getting back to

500
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,290
them is one of the worst
things you can do.

501
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,160
And it's probably some of
the biggest causes of

502
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,034
churn in the early stages of
start-ups.

503
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,430
This is how support worked
out with Wufoo.

504
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,250
When we were acquired we had
about 500,000 users on

505
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,230
the system, 5 million people
used Wufoo forms and

506
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,940
reports, whether they knew
it or not, and

507
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,100
all those people got support
from the same ten people,

508
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,640
and usually it was

509
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,200
only one person dedicated
support a day, or any shift.

510
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,180
Results in about 400 issues
a week.

511
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,110
That's about 800 emails.

512
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,928
But a response time from 9
a.m.

513
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:06,440
to 9 p.m.
was

514
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,865
between seven to 12 minutes.

515
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:08,980
Right?
And from 9 p.m.

516
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,130
to midnight it was an hour.

517
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,030
And on the weekend it would
be no longer than 24 hours.

518
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,020
And we carried this up all
the way up to the scale.

519
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,780
What a lot of people forget
about, and

520
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,020
often talk about with
Airbnb, is how, like oh,

521
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,870
they did this interesting
thing where they had,

522
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,700
went up to New York and
offered, like,

523
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,280
professional photographers,
and the founders would go

524
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
out there and actually take
pictures of

525
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,860
the people's apartments to
help them sell more.

526
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,390
Focusing on the stories
around conversion.

527
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,440
What most people don't
realize is a lot of

528
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,783
times when I saw Joe in the
early days of Airbnb,

529
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,301
he had a phone, sort of head
set stuck to his head all

530
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,072
the time, because he was
doing phone support nonstop.

531
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,307
Churn is a story we don't
like to talk about often,

532
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,280
all the time.

533
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,540
Airbnb's sort of growth
really started picking up

534
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,440
once they figured out

535
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,030
how to match capacity to the
demand, or the phone

536
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,730
calls that they were getting
into their support system.

537
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,960
At Wufoo we actually
constantly did experiments

538
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,550
around support, because
we're so obsessed with it.

539
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,540
One experiment we did was,
we heard Kathy Sierra

540
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,860
do a talk about there's a
disconnect between the

541
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,580
motions that we have when we
need help, and sort of.

542
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,620
The content and the
reactions we get from

543
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,430
people when we get help from
them, especially online.

544
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,780
Because they just don't see
all those nonverbal cues.

545
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,440
So she said unless there's
face recognition on the web,

546
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,420
we're just always going to
be

547
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,980
disconnected from our users.

548
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,760
Our feeling was,

549
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,110
like, well we're not face
recognition experts but

550
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,700
I think there's another way
of getting empathy.

551
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,710
So, as form builders, we
added a drop-down and

552
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,590
what we said was like, hey,
what's your emotional state?

553
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,180
And our hypothesis was

554
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,300
that no one was gonna fill
this out.

555
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,790
We basically thought, oh
okay, you know what the,

556
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,910
this is gonna be pretty a
lame experiment, but

557
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,930
we'll see how it sort of
goes.

558
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,125
And it turned out the
Emotional State

559
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,770
drop-down field was filled
out 75.8% of the time.

560
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,374
The browser type drop-down
filled just in

561
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,184
comparison was filled out
78.1% of the time.

562
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:00,816
All right?

563
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:03,337
So people were basically
telling us, for

564
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:06,506
my technical support issue
how I feel about this

565
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:10,036
problem is just as important
as, like, all the technical

566
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:13,220
details you need to sorta
figure out how to debug it.

567
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,580
Now we didn't prioritize
things or

568
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,380
triage things by emotion,
right, and for

569
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,860
the most part, people didn't
game the system.

570
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,820
One of the interesting
byproducts of it was that we

571
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,450
noticed that people started
being nicer to

572
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,850
us in the customer support.

573
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,270
It was something sort of
subconscious.

574
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,590
We just were thinking like,
wow,

575
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,870
users are so much better
now.

576
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,430
What's going on?

577
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,710
And we went back and looked
at the data and

578
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,910
we did some text analysis
and we realized is that, oh,

579
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,790
when it comes to only
communicating with

580
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,620
people over written words,
like email, there's

581
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,750
only three ways that you
show strong emotions, right?

582
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,560
Exclamation marks curse
words, and all caps.

583
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,140
And sure enough on all three
of those metrics,

584
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,840
they've gone down.

585
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,070
In sort of the way people
were talking to us in

586
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,340
the customer support.

587
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Once people had a simple
outlet for their emotions,

588
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,340
right, people would be a lot
more rational,

589
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,997
and it made our jobs a lot
more pleasant as a result.

590
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:08,860
The other byproduct that is
awesome is that

591
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,280
you actually build better
software when you do this.

592
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,310
Far better software.

593
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,090
This is actually backed up
by tons of research.

594
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,190
Jared Spool, a user
interface engineer, which is

595
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,745
sort of the big players in
this space says like,

596
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,400
there's a direct correlation
to how much time we

597
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,810
spend directly exposed to
users and

598
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,080
how good our designs sort of
get.

599
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
He says it has to come in
this specific way.

600
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,680
It has to be direct
exposure, right?

601
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,710
It can't be something where

602
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,370
someone generates a report
or through a graph, you

603
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,070
have to be interacting with
them somewhat real time.

604
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,290
It has to be a minimum of
every six weeks.

605
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,180
And it has to be for at
least two hours.

606
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,720
Otherwise your software will
get worse over time.

607
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,086
Our developers, our people
who are on,

608
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:51,200
on Wufoo were getting
exposed to our users four to

609
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,820
eight hours every single
week.

610
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,570
And what it does is it
changes the way you sort of

611
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,437
build software.

612
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,150
Jared Spool has another way
of talking about how

613
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,380
we build products.

614
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,650
Right?

615
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,780
Let's imagine that this
represents all the knowledge

616
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,900
needed to sort of use your
app on a spectrum.

617
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,770
Right?
This is like no knowledge.

618
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,340
Right?
And this is

619
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,780
all the knowledge needed.

620
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,300
Right?
And

621
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,280
these two lines are pretty
much your interactions with

622
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,610
users what you're trying to
get them to.

623
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:20,270
This is currently where
their knowledge point is and

624
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,460
this is the target knowledge
point that you're trying to

625
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,250
get them to, to understand
that to use your app.

626
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,102
The gap between those is
called the knowledge gap,

627
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,497
Jared Spool called it, Spool
calls.

628
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:31,846
And what's interesting about
this is there's only two

629
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,280
ways, right, to sort of fix
this.

630
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,130
That gap represents how
intuitive your

631
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,010
app is, right?

632
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,210
You either get the user to
increase their

633
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,080
knowledge or you decrease
the amount of knowledge

634
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,872
that's needed to use your
application.

635
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:48,450
And oftentimes, as engineers
and people who build and

636
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,699
work on products, we think
let's add new features.

637
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,790
And new features only

638
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,150
means let's increase the
knowledge gap.

639
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,070
So for us we actually
focused a lot on

640
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,792
the other sort of direction.

641
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,530
And so what that meant we
spent a lot of time,

642
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,870
30% of our engineering time
was spent on internal tools

643
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,102
to help with our customer
support stuff.

644
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:10,020
But oftentimes it

645
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,750
was spent helping people
help themselves.

646
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,870
Things like frequently asked
questions, tool tips.

647
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,650
Things like, if you just
click the help link,

648
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,510
right, instead of taking you
to the generic help sort of

649
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,480
documentation page,

650
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,150
you go to the specific page
where you're looking at

651
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,540
is going to be most, sort
of,

652
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,960
appropriate for what you're
working on.

653
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
We redesigned our
documentation over and

654
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,870
over again, AB tested it
constantly.

655
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,040
One iteration of our
documentation reduced

656
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,029
customer support by 30% over
night.

657
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,090
It's one of those things
where,

658
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,400
like, overnight, all the
people that work on

659
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,960
the product immediately had
30% less work to do.

660
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,490
Now what happens if you have
everyone work on

661
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,630
customer support constantly,
and

662
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,220
thinking about it in terms
of a remarkable way?

663
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,430
Well, I talked a lot about,

664
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,290
in the very beginning growth
is a function of

665
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,000
conversion and churn.

666
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,140
This is Wufoo's growth curve
for the first five years.

667
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,270
Right?

668
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,390
What's interesting is that
we

669
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,020
paid no money on
advertising, on marketing.

670
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,720
All of it was done by word
of mouth growth.

671
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,800
Right?

672
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,480
And the interaction between,
like,

673
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,460
new users and downgrades are
this.

674
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,940
It's so slight what it
takes, that gap,

675
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,800
making that sort of work.

676
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,710
And what a lot of people
keep forgetting is that

677
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,970
there's almost no difference
between an increase in

678
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,370
conversion rate, 1% increase
and a 1% decrease churn.

679
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,840
They do exactly the same
thing to your growth.

680
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,710
However, the ladder is
actually much easier to do.

681
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,380
It's much cheaper to do, in
your apps, and

682
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,940
a lot of the times we
neglect this,

683
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,010
neglect this to way far
along.

684
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,960
Right?
And we usually have our

685
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,090
B team works on these sort
of projects and services.

686
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,770
This is actually not the
graph that we track most of

687
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,250
the time at Wufoo, it's not
even the one I'm proud of.

688
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,855
This is the one I'm proud
of.

689
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:54,980
Cuz even though we have this
sort of nice, awesome curve

690
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,040
of growth, this is what, how
loud is this scale?

691
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,340
Keep the company small, have
an awesome culture.

692
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
And that required doing a
lot of

693
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,796
these things to help people
sort of do what they need.

694
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:13,709
So John Gotman noticed there
was a different type of

695
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:18,978
behavior for relationships
and why people divorced.

696
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:21,938
Basically there would be
some subset of people who

697
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:24,404
would stay together 10, 15
years and

698
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:26,870
then all of a sudden they
divorce and

699
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,899
there was none of the other
indicators which sort of

700
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,320
show that this is what was
gonna happen.

701
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,067
And I was looking through
the data and

702
00:27:34,067 --> 00:27:35,868
I realized oh, there's no
passion,

703
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:38,194
there's no fire between
these people, right?

704
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,679
When it comes to
relationships they

705
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,059
kinda follow the second law
of thermodynamics, right?

706
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,506
In a closed energy system
things tend to run down so

707
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,662
you have to constantly be
putting energy and

708
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:47,720
effort back into it.

709
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,430
Now the way a lot of people
sort of think about showing

710
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,040
people that I care about you
in products and in companies

711
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,870
is to do things like let's
have a blog, right?

712
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,240
Lets' have a newsletter?

713
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,870
The thing is, we look at
these rates and basically it

714
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,960
was such a small percentage
of our active users that it

715
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,290
was like, most of our users
have no idea all

716
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,660
the awesome stuff that we're
doing for them.

717
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,980
So we built a new tool.

718
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,540
We called it the Wufoo
system, and

719
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,570
what it allowed us to do was
just time stamp every new

720
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,990
feature that we're building
for users and

721
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,540
then every time they would
log in, we would look at

722
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,830
the difference between their
log in time or last log in

723
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,580
time and the new features
that were implemented.

724
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,120
And when you had this
message show up,

725
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,030
hey since you've been gone

726
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,800
here's all the awesome stuff
that Wufoo did for you.

727
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,840
Hands down this was the most
talked about feature I've

728
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,585
ever had every time I went
out to talk to users.

729
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,860
Right they'd say like dude I
love that since you've be,

730
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,490
since you've gone thing even
though I pay the same amount

731
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,510
every single month you guys
are doing something for

732
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,110
me almost every week and
it's totally awesome and

733
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,780
makes me feel, I'm getting
maximum value.

734
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
The other thing that we did
in

735
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,030
addition to having everyone
support the people that

736
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,500
paid their pay check is have
them say thank you.

737
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,790
And this was a large part
due to us injecting sort of

738
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,280
humility and modesty in to
sort of the equation.

739
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,270
Every single Friday we would
get together and

740
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,350
we'd just write simple hand
written thank you cards to

741
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,029
our users.

742
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,606
And I know there's tons of
people who would not be sort

743
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,799
of excited about doing this,
but it was a ritual that

744
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:16,485
made sort of all the
difference in terms of,

745
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:19,822
like, having a team that was
very tightly neat,

746
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:21,226
tightly knit, also.

747
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,190
And working on stuff that
they really cared about.

748
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,130
They always constantly knew
what the mission was for,

749
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,960
and why we sort of did what
we did.

750
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,010
These aren't fancy thank you
cards, right?

751
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,810
They're just simple,

752
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,860
like handwritten stuff on an
index card.

753
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,990
We threw in a sticker, and

754
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,140
slapped on a dinosaur on the
front of it.

755
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,720
And, what's interesting is
we started this practice as

756
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,830
a result of the early days
of starting Wufoo.

757
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,039
Chris, Ron, and I were
talking, and we're trying to

758
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,103
figure out, what are we
gonna do to sort of show

759
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,139
users that we appreciate
them around Christmas.

760
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:55,341
And he, Chris came up with
this idea where he said

761
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:58,825
hey guys, so a couple years
ago my mom, like, made me

762
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:01,831
write thank you notes to all
of my relatives.

763
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,555
For my Christmas gifts.

764
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,044
And I didn't really like to
do it but

765
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,750
the following year all my
presents were super good.

766
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,170
So, I think we should try
this for our business and

767
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,770
see how it goes.

768
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,320
So, that first year we wrote
handwritten Christmas cards

769
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,750
to all of our users that
first year.

770
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,360
Second year rolls around,
and

771
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,680
we have too many customers,
like, and

772
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,670
it's still just the three
founders.

773
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,920
And we were going like we're
kinda screwed,

774
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,650
I don't know what we're
gonna do.

775
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,940
And we read a book called
the ultimate question, and

776
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,540
in it he talks about hey,

777
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,490
just focus on your most
profitable users.

778
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,510
And just tend them and

779
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,330
take care of them, then
it'll work out.

780
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:38,910
So we're like, all right,

781
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,000
that, that makes sense,
that's scalable.

782
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,770
So that year we

783
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,459
only write to our highest
paying customers.

784
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,630
And the January rolls around
that second year and

785
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,540
one of our long time loyal
users writes us and

786
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,620
he's basically like, hey
guys I, I really loved

787
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,290
that Christmas card you sent
me the first year and I just

788
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,000
wanted you to know I haven't
received my second card yet

789
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,520
and I'm just looking forward
to it.

790
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,040
I know you didn't forget
about me.

791
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,400
Thanks a lot.

792
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,930
So we're like, fuck, because
the best way to sort of

793
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,890
exceed expectations is not
to send any to begin with,

794
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,500
so we were like sort of in
this conundrum.

795
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,940
And what we decided, after
thinking about it for

796
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,270
a while, is that we need to
stop doing it,

797
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,400
you know, just one time a
year.

798
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,760
It needs to be something
that's part of the culture.

799
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,800
Happens every, every, every
sort of week, even.

800
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,950
And even though we'll never
catch up to all of

801
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,050
our customers.

802
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,710
Just the practice of

803
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,490
doing it will make all the
difference.

804
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,310
I talked a lot

805
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:37,320
about a bunch of like
lovey-dovey stuff and

806
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,470
sort of like touchy-feely
things that I think a lot of

807
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,450
engineers don't like to
think about too often.

808
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,570
And so I'll end on some sort
of hard business

809
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,320
data or research.

810
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
There's an article that was
put out by

811
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,220
the Harvard Business Review
several years ago by

812
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,080
Michael Treacy and Fred
Wiersema and in it they

813
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,560
talk about the discipline of
market leaders.

814
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,360
They say there's only three
ways that you

815
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,630
achieve market dominance and
depending on how you want to

816
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,300
achieve that market
dominance you have

817
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,870
to organize your company in
a very specific way.

818
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,350
Best price, best product and
best overall solution.

819
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,860
If you want to be

820
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,270
the best price out there you
focus on logistics.

821
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,680
A Wal-Mart, an Amazon.

822
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,390
If you want to be the best
product out there you

823
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,540
focus on R&D.

824
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,460
Apple's usually

825
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,490
a quintessential example of
that.

826
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,040
Best overall solution is
about

827
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,930
being customer intimate.

828
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,410
And this is the path that
you see followed by

829
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,950
luxury brands and
hospitality industry.

830
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,400
What I love about this path
towards market dominance is

831
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,750
that the third one is the
only one that

832
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,620
everyone can do at any stage
of their company.

833
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,460
Requires almost no money to
get started with.

834
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,540
Usually just co.

835
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,780
Requires a little bit of
humility and some manners.

836
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,590
And as a result you can
achieve the success as any

837
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,190
other people in sort of your
market.

838
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,680
That's all I got.

839
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,340
Thank you very much.

840
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,230
Yeah, let's take some
questions if you guys

841
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,912
have any.

842
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:04,854
Right in the back there.

843
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:07,339
>> Building products that
users love?

844
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,342
You might have multiple
different types of users.

845
00:33:10,342 --> 00:33:14,150
How do you build one product
that all users love?

846
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,150
Maybe there is a feature
that one really likes but

847
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,110
detracts value from one
that.

848
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,150
>> All right.
So what do you do

849
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,950
when you have a product with
lots of

850
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,250
different type of users,
right?

851
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,490
Some users will love one
thing and

852
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,250
another will, will another.

853
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,970
And I agree, there's

854
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,290
a interesting fine line for
that.

855
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,370
What I always, usually tell
people,

856
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,070
is focus on the people who
are the most passionate,

857
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,360
especially in the early
stages.

858
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,020
Right?
Whoever's, whatever niche

859
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,320
it's gonna be, that's who I
focus on completely.

860
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,280
Things that a lot of
different projects did.

861
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,140
I think Ben Silverman of

862
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,290
Pinterest started off with a
designer bloggers, right?

863
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,090
Curtail your thing for

864
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,610
them and eventually you'll
figure out sort of universal

865
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,150
values that will appeal to a
lot of other people.

866
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,920
So, just start one at a
time.

867
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,720
And.

868
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,900
The, a lot of the examples
that you see up there,

869
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,280
a lot of people make the
mistake is like, oh,

870
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,960
I'll just make my app funny.

871
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,130
But, humor is like really
difficult to do.

872
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,200
Right?
What you wanna shoot for

873
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,350
is something sort of witty.

874
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,720
And, quite honestly,

875
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,730
you have to get
functionality right.

876
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,220
So like the Japanese
quality.

877
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,210
If you don't have a on
there, right, don't try to

878
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,100
do anything witty, right,
cuz it will backfire on you.

879
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,807
So hands down, our number
one focus is make it as

880
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:18,108
easy to use as possible for
and

881
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:20,016
anything else on top was
polish.

882
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:20,596
Right here.

883
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:28,310
>> So so everybody says that
to focus on your product.

884
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,030
I'm also good at that.

885
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,300
I love to do a project and I
love to make it the best.

886
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,100
But we are to that certain
point that we are focused on

887
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,510
our product but we don't get
like constantly right?

888
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,270
Sorry.

889
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:41,640
So second thing so how much
we should focus on product?

890
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
But because we should do now
marketing.

891
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,490
We should get somebody
customers and

892
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,980
like and like start talking
to customers but

893
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,180
when you are too focused on
your product.

894
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,940
Like users online have them.

895
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,461
Right, so what exactly do
you guys mean when you

896
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,856
are saying like focus only
on your product and

897
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,130
give the best product?

898
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,548
>> Okay.

899
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,955
So the question sort of is
how do we balance this

900
00:35:04,955 --> 00:35:07,889
sort of thing where we wanna
be obsessed with

901
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,800
working on product.

902
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,630
Yet.
But all the other skills,

903
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,080
and sort of tasks that are
needed by a company,

904
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,510
like marketing and branding
and

905
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,730
all that stuff, and how, how
we sort of balance that.

906
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,100
And the thing is, like, it
starts off as you juggling,

907
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,540
like, tons of things
constantly in the air.

908
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,440
The thing is, if you're
working on products, like,

909
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,500
you should also always have
this flip side as

910
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,050
when you're talking to
users.

911
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,560
Right?
And for

912
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,010
us inside of Wufoo, the way
we got people to talk to

913
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,440
users is they just did
customer support.

914
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,680
And they got to see
firsthand, right away.

915
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,930
Whether that feature sucked
or not,

916
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,500
and also impacted everyone
else in the company,

917
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,420
because everyone had a
customer support shift.

918
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,170
So you have this sort of
social incentive to sort of

919
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,360
make everything work.

920
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,150
And so, like I said, there
should be no point where

921
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,230
you're only focused on
product.

922
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,340
You should always have time
where you work on product,

923
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,420
and then you see sort of
what users say, say to you.

924
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,270
And you should always have
this virtual, like,

925
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,420
feedback loop on there.

926
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,630
So be careful when you don't
have that.

927
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,340
Usually what ends up
happening, if you're lucky.

928
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,070
In terms of marketing and

929
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,070
sales, like, usually my
feeling is like, you have to

930
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,090
spend money on marketing and
advertising, all this stuff.

931
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,680
It's usually a tax you pay
because you

932
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,280
haven't made your product
remarkable.

933
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,510
Right?

934
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,630
Word of mouth growth is the
easiest kind of growth, and

935
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,260
it's how a lot of the great
companies sort of grow.

936
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,220
So figure out how to wait,
how to like,

937
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,120
have a story that people
want to tell.

938
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,830
About your product.

939
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,400
Where they're the most
interesting person at

940
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,660
the dinner table, right?

941
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,820
And then that person is your
sales person, right?

942
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,462
That person is your sales
force for you.

943
00:36:25,462 --> 00:36:28,106
Right here.

944
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:32,112
>> like, where do you find
crystal clear customer or

945
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:36,140
user need and the demand is
there is the right solution.

946
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,100
How do you communicate with
engineering and

947
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,710
designing team to make sure
that because sometimes

948
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,470
people in the team come up
with ideas, and but

949
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,620
still at the end of the day,

950
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,340
how can you make a decision
with where to go?

951
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,300
>> Oh, so how do you make a
decision on product?

952
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,000
And communicate that with
your sort of

953
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,350
engineering team when
there's like lots of

954
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,410
different directions to go?

955
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,950
My feeling is that.

956
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,180
So for us we just looked at
support.

957
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
It was really easy cuz

958
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,480
you often just saw what are
things that

959
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,410
people are having the most
amount of problems with?

960
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,980
Or people asking all the
time.

961
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,360
You cannot help but get
feature requests from

962
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
people no matter like
whatever opening or

963
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,940
orifice you have in your
product or app.

964
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,430
Like, people will like jam
feature requests in there.

965
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,210
So you're easily going to

966
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,450
know sort of what they sort
of what.

967
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,270
Your job as a product person
and

968
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:25,050
engineer is to not just do
what they say, because that

969
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,068
way, you'll just be a slave,
is to figure out,

970
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,930
sort of deeply, what are the
reasons why underlying those

971
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,410
things and sort of solve
that deep underlying reason.

972
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,606
The thing is that everyone
wants to

973
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:35,990
have a different way of.

974
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,390
To sort of go, then
ultimately it comes down to,

975
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,850
like, someone's gonna figure
something out.

976
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,180
But I also make the smallest
version of each little idea.

977
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,080
No longer than a week or two
weeks to build it out there.

978
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,980
And you can try them out and

979
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,890
see sort of what works and
don't work.

980
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,060
I think it's dangerous to

981
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,800
have multiple different
product directions that

982
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,879
requires lots of time to
sort of figure out.

983
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,050
Sam.

984
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,760
>> Related to that can you
tell the story of

985
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,910
how the king for a day thing
>> Yeah.

986
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,770
Okay.
So

987
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,760
so I don't like hackathons.

988
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,660
I think they sort of suck in
terms of ones done inside

989
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,210
of companies.

990
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,270
Because.

991
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,937
You spend like 48 hours
working on something really

992
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:16,125
hard that you're sort of
passionate about and

993
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:20,280
99% of them never make it to
production right, and

994
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,410
it's sort, sort of real like
super sad.

995
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,190
So for us we like flipped it
on it's head and

996
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,720
we came up with an idea that
we called king for

997
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,060
a day and it actually worked
over the weekend.

998
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,920
But how it worked is someone
randomly in the company got

999
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,660
drawn and they got to be the
king, and the king got to

1000
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,400
tell everyone else what to
do on the product.

1001
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,850
So everything that was
bothering them about Wufoo.

1002
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,890
About the customer support
stuff, or

1003
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,530
some feature they really
want to have built.

1004
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,440
They've got the engineering
resources, the market

1005
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,650
resources, the advertising
resources of everyone inside

1006
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,670
of the company, to make it
sort of happen.

1007
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,770
And of course, we'd work
with them to

1008
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,200
figure out like what can be
actually done in 48 hours.

1009
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,730
But we would do this one to
two times a year.

1010
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,820
And it was like a huge hit
and

1011
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,310
it was a boost to morale,
cuz what people most love.

1012
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,810
It is like working on things
where it's like, oh,

1013
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,020
I made a difference to the
app.

1014
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,700
Right?

1015
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,030
And so, for us, that's one
way that we would like

1016
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,370
sort of divide time for like
product direction.

1017
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,010
It's like some times the
people that work for

1018
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,730
you, they have a strong
opinion about where it,

1019
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,400
where it should go.

1020
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,580
And it's a good way to sort
of democratize it

1021
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,939
a little bit, by rotating it
around.

1022
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,520
Yes.

1023
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,760
>> You said you guys all
work from home.

1024
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,450
Usually seems like a
nightmare.

1025
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,510
In that office, how do you
make that work?

1026
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,510
>> Okay, so we all work from
home.

1027
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,540
So, I will tell you this.

1028
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,610
We all still work within the
Tampa Bay area.

1029
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,760
We would allow anybody to

1030
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,510
work from any where but
usually.

1031
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,904
As we tried to recruit
them,they sort of

1032
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:37,820
meet our team, and they just
decide,

1033
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,500
okay we just want to come
and move here anyway.

1034
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:46,563
Remote working, is
especially tricky,

1035
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:48,350
a lot of people like to
romanticize it,

1036
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,430
especially people, who are
like employees.

1037
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:54,110
But the thing is, An office
gives you a lot of, sort of,

1038
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,870
benefits, right, and
efficiencies that you now

1039
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,880
have to compensate for when
you remote working.

1040
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,770
But remote working also has
these other sort of

1041
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,590
efficiencies in place, for
example,

1042
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,870
I don't have to worry about
my employees losing two

1043
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,570
hours of their day to
commuting, for instance.

1044
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,980
So the biggest thing that we
had to do for

1045
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,860
remote working is to respect
people's time.

1046
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,500
And so the way we had it set
up is we actually had

1047
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,470
a four and a half day work
week at Wufoo.

1048
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,840
Half day on Friday was for
all the meetings and stuff.

1049
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,830
We said like no business
deal,

1050
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,990
meetings, no talking with
other outside parties.

1051
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,570
They all have to be done on
Friday, on that half day.

1052
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,320
It couldn't be done in the
middle of the week.

1053
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,420
And then also one day of
everyone was

1054
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,780
already dedicated customer
support.

1055
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,910
So everyone in our company
effectively only had

1056
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,170
three days each week to
actually build or

1057
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,570
work on whatever they were
doing.

1058
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,370
But I actually firmly
believe that if you

1059
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:41,270
have three solid days,
right, eight to ten hours,

1060
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,230
where you are only working
on what you need to build,

1061
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,350
you can get a ton of shit
done.

1062
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,060
And so what we said was,

1063
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,770
you have to respect
everyone's time during that

1064
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,130
three day period, if they're
in that three day period.

1065
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,270
And what we came up with is
a 15 minute rule and the way

1066
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,580
it worked is you can have a
discussion like a chat or

1067
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,380
a phone call or whatever
with someone but it could go

1068
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,640
no longer than 15 minutes so
if you have some complicated

1069
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,050
issue that you couldn't
figure out we'd say,

1070
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,320
at 15 minutes you are to
immediately table that item.

1071
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,050
Right and have us discuss it
on Friday and

1072
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,610
you'd move on to the next
item on your list right,

1073
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,690
the enhanced productivity.

1074
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:18,430
More often than not I, I
would say 90% of the time

1075
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,450
the item never got brought
up on Friday because usually

1076
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,810
what would happen is people
would sleep on it and then

1077
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,730
they'd just magically say
like, hey I found a solution

1078
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,740
or like hey that's not a big
problem whatsoever.

1079
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,760
Because most problems inside
of companies,

1080
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,290
they don't need to be solved
in real time, or right away.

1081
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,990
The only things are like
when the site is down, or

1082
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,310
payments aren't working.

1083
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:39,490
Right?
Everything outside of

1084
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,480
that is basically kind of
luxury, so

1085
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,520
focus on your primaries as
much as possible.

1086
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,419
And, as a result,

1087
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:48,445
our ten person team did far
more than many,

1088
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:51,150
many other companies, as a
result.

1089
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,040
But, it takes extra work to
make remote working happen.

1090
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,070
We are an extremely
disciplined sort of team.

1091
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,370
And I would have to say

1092
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,850
there's almost not many YC
companies that actually have

1093
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,300
been able to replicate sort
of what we do.

1094
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,250
I think there's only two
other companies in YC that

1095
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,060
sort of have the same sort
of discipline working style.

1096
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,560
It takes more work in a very
different fashion.

1097
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,100
Right?

1098
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,780
An office allows you to be a
little bit lazier, right,

1099
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,620
in terms of all these things
around productivity.

1100
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Okay.
Over here.

1101
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,330
>> Right.

1102
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,440
Just to go off that question
as the leader of the team

1103
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,891
how did you manage to
instill a company culture

1104
00:42:29,891 --> 00:42:30,948
but and also the count,

1105
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,180
accountability the employees
especially cuz.

1106
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,700
Working space.

1107
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,700
>> Okay, how do we, how do
we set up accountability for

1108
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,390
employees?

1109
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,230
As, as a manager.

1110
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,530
Alright, so, at Wufoo we
were profitable nine months

1111
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,920
after launch, so, we had
profit sharing, right?

1112
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,510
And so, it makes pretty
simple and clear.

1113
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,110
It, it would be a multiple
of whatever bonus pull that

1114
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,420
we sort of had, and

1115
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,720
the performance measures
would be based on sort of,

1116
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,350
how they did in customer
support.

1117
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,880
All right, on their duties
there, and sort of

1118
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,810
what they said they were
wanting to accomplish or do.

1119
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,790
I don't like process, and I
don't like lots of

1120
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,110
tools to help get people to
be productive.

1121
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,547
So the only thing that we
had for

1122
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,040
helping people manage, like,

1123
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,270
sort of their projects, is
to-do lists.

1124
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,810
And that is, like, simple
text files that we

1125
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,490
shared in our Dropbox
account.

1126
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,380
Each person had their name
on it, and you got to

1127
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,710
see every time somebody
updated their to-do list.

1128
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,060
What we said is every single
night just

1129
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,650
set everything that you did
that day.

1130
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,560
Right?
And then on Friday,

1131
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,690
we would just go over.

1132
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,770
Okay, this is what you

1133
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,970
said last week that you're
gonna do.

1134
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,240
This is what you actually
got done, or

1135
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,350
the sort of the problems at
hand.

1136
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:31,370
And it's super simple,
right?

1137
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,650
It creates this like nice
written trail for

1138
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,550
how to sort of handle stuff,
right?

1139
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,720
And I don't have to worry
about managing them, right?

1140
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,300
They sorta set the tone for

1141
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,610
how they want to be sort of
assessed.

1142
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:42,550
And it makes it really
simple.

1143
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:45,370
And for people who are
excellent at what they do.

1144
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,050
Right?
It works very, very well.

1145
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,900
And then when you actually
have problems,

1146
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,570
it's very easy to fire
people.

1147
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:51,760
I was fortunate that I

1148
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,110
never had to fire anyone at
Wufoo, right?

1149
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,490
But we were able to correct
a lot of

1150
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,530
people's behavior very, very
quickly.

1151
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,750
Cuz we just kinda look at
this, and

1152
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:00,160
it's like look, this is your
pattern of behavior.

1153
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,510
You finish a fraction of the
items on your list.

1154
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,090
You do most of

1155
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,810
the items at the last second
right before Friday.

1156
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,240
That's a problem, you've
gotta manage your time

1157
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,260
better and this is evidence
that you've provided to us.

1158
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,420
All we have to do is sort of
describe it back to you and

1159
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,065
because everyone in the
company sort of sees it,

1160
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:16,000
right, there's social
pressure that's put

1161
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,870
into place that helps make
it all sort of happen.

1162
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,810
Right here.

1163
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,930
>> How did you hire people
that, you know,

1164
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,630
you felt would be able to
work with in this kind of

1165
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,216
environment that's, that's
>> So,

1166
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:31,720
how do you hire people that
can work, remotely?

1167
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,990
And then sort of work in
this sort of fashion.

1168
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,880
So, pretty easily,

1169
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,170
you have them work on a side
project for you.

1170
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,330
So you contract them out,
and

1171
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,920
they have to work remotely.

1172
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,610
As such, usually, the
projects I like to

1173
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,160
have them work on is about a
month long, right?

1174
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,840
I could do things much
faster for a week.

1175
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,010
But usually get a good sense
of,

1176
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,870
like, how well people sort
of manage themselves, and

1177
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,930
work on things from a
project like that.

1178
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,750
So that was always the first
assessment.

1179
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,560
Like we never did anything
just by interviews.

1180
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,740
The other thing we had to,
sort of, screen them for

1181
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,350
is their ability to do
customer support.

1182
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,190
Because not any,

1183
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,980
every engineer sort of has
the empathy skills to

1184
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,130
handle that stress.

1185
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,100
So sometimes I would have
people write breakup letters

1186
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,440
to me, right, in an
interview, just like hey,

1187
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,310
pretend you have to break up
with me you have 15 minutes

1188
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:19,320
to write in on there and you
can only write it by hand,

1189
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,600
what are you gonna say?

1190
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,740
And so you get a good sense
of sort of their writing

1191
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,670
skills, because like 90% of
what you do in customer

1192
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,940
support is tell them bad
news, like, oh, we don't

1193
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,710
support that feature, sorry
that's not gonna work, or.

1194
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,070
It's not gonna be available.

1195
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,985
And so people have to have
sort of tacked at that.

1196
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:36,300
>> How 'bout one more
question?

1197
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,650
>> One question, right here
the glasses.

1198
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,430
>> So, since Wiki has all
these like tricks and

1199
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,530
experiments that have really
helped the company.

1200
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,950
Do you INAUDIBLE] of ones
that didn't work out?

1201
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,120
>> Have all these tricks and

1202
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,240
experiments to help the
company,

1203
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,360
are there any ones that
didn't work out?

1204
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,520
All right, I'll talk about
one.

1205
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,770
So one of the things that we
did early on to try to

1206
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,940
motivate ourselves was try
to get,

1207
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,300
like we understood this idea
of like crunch mode and

1208
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,820
that it's really bad for
people.

1209
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,370
Like if you're doing the
subscription business you

1210
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,230
need people to last for the
long term, and

1211
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,400
video games a lot of times
they like crunch people.

1212
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,660
All, all the time.

1213
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,860
For like a specific deadline
or

1214
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,610
have multiple sprints every
two weeks and

1215
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,930
you have to shoot up to this
deadline and

1216
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,290
it's like exhausting.

1217
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,090
And so, because, when it's
happening it's like you

1218
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,560
might get an increase in
productivity but

1219
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,300
the recovery period that you
need for people is

1220
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,770
always greater, right, than
the productivity you gain.

1221
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,630
And at a company where you

1222
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:25,810
need everyone doing customer
support and

1223
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,420
being on their game and
constantly put, pushed out

1224
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,910
features you don't have time
for recovery.

1225
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,490
So, we were thinking about,
okay, we want to build like,

1226
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,740
a company vacation into how
Wufoo sort of works to

1227
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,300
reward our users every
single year.

1228
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:38,830
And we said okay,

1229
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,330
if the vacation is sort of
built in there for

1230
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:43,030
the recovery, we could have
one crunch period, right,

1231
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,300
before that vacation set up.

1232
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,470
And we'll just only do
customer support that will

1233
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,430
just sort of scale with
people.

1234
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,260
So.

1235
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,070
The way we did the very
first crunch mode

1236
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,380
is that it was just between
the three founders.

1237
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,900
And we had each of us draw a
ten-item to-do list.

1238
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,140
That would be fairly
aggressive.

1239
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,890
And the first person to

1240
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,640
get through seven of their
items would win.

1241
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,030
And the the last person to

1242
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,630
get through seven of their
items.

1243
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,950
Would become what we called
trippage.

1244
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,180
And trippage meant that you
carried other

1245
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,630
person's luggage and got
people drinks when you're on

1246
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,500
the company vacation.

1247
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,540
So we did that and during
that period,

1248
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,140
everyone was like pretty
excited about it and

1249
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,850
motivated, and only the
winner got to

1250
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:27,640
choose the next company
vacation the following year.

1251
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,240
And then all the sudden Ryan
had basically poorly

1252
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,050
estimated the items on his
list.

1253
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,400
And he realized very quickly
I'm going to fucking lose.

1254
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,950
And so he was just like I
give up.

1255
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:40,250
And he just sort of stopped.

1256
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,410
So crunch mode turned out to
be blah mode for

1257
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,340
him because he knew he was
gonna lose and

1258
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,030
became pretty demoralized.

1259
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,380
So as a result of doing
that, we

1260
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,130
decided not to do it in that
similar fashion anymore.

1261
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,610
So, good idea that we like
to talk about.

1262
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,980
But is one that we, we never
did again.

1263
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,750
All right, guys.

1264
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,930
Thanks a lot.

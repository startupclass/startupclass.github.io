WEBVTT

00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:01.805
Yeah.

00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:03.219
Thanks for having me, Sam.
I'm Stanley.

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.112
I'm the founder of DoorDash
and it's really amazing to

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:12.379
be here because it wasn't
actually that long ago

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.080
where I sat in your seats I
was class of 2014.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.632
Graduated in CS, as well as
my co-founder, Andy.

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:22.640
And, for those of you who
don't know what Doordash is,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.456
we're building an on-demand
delivery network for

00:00:25.456 --> 00:00:26.930
local cities.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.730
And I wanna start off with
this photo that I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.670
took just a few months ago,
and I think

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.070
this was the night when we
just raised our series A.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.080
And I took this photo as I
was walking back

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.480
to where I lived.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.570
I actually lived in Robly at
the time, on campus.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.583
And, I took this photo
because I realized just how

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:50.886
ridiculous the combinations
of things I was holding in

00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:52.391
my hand at that time, and

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:54.640
I was holding my CS 247
homework.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.660
And then, I had my tax
forms,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.530
since it was April and I had
to fill out taxes.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.452
And then also that yellow
speeding ticket,

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:07.020
and then right below that
was a $15 million

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.740
dollar piece of paper I just
signed from Sequoia.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
And that kind of summarizes
just how ridiculous our

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.060
journey has been, you know,
starting at Stanford.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.260
Doing this while I was at
Stanford, and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.980
then transitioning this into
an actual startup, and

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.740
I want to share that story
with you today.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.590
It all began two years ago,
actually,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.270
in a macaron store, it was
my junior year at Stanford.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.230
This was fall quarter, and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.370
at that time, I was really
passionate about, you know,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.850
how do you build technology
for small business owners?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
And I sat down Chloe, the
owner of,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.932
you know, Chantal Guillon,

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:48.470
a macaron store in Palo Alto
at that time.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.000
Just interviewing her, you
know,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.400
trying to get feedback on
this product prototype we'd

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.010
been working on.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.020
And also just learning
about,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.870
you know, what her problems
were in general.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.820
And it was during this
meeting when Chloe first

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.902
brought up this problem of
delivery.

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:06.580
You know, I remember she
took out this really,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.980
really thick booklet.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.530
And she showed me pages and
pages of delivery orders.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.510
And a lot of these orders
she had to turn down because

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.440
there's no way she could
have fulfilled them,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.720
as she had no drivers and
she was the one who ended up

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.480
having to personally deliver
all these orders.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.800
And that was a very
interesting moment for us.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.260
And then we felt next, over
the next course of,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.200
over the course of the next
few weeks, we talked to,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.040
you know, around another
150,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
200 small business owners,
and when we brought up

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.990
this idea of delivery, they
kept, you know, they kept,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.310
you know, agreeing with us,
saying yeah,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.400
this is a really big problem
for us, you know.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.960
We don't have a delivery
infrastructure.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.430
It's such a huge pain for
us.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.720
There's not any good
solutions out there.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.120
And which led us to wonder,
you know,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.260
delivery is such a common
thing.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.950
You know, it's such an
obvious thing.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.700
Why hasn't anyone solved
this before, right?

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.180
Like, we must be missing
something here.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.609
So, we thought maybe because
people have tried this in

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.808
the past, right.

00:03:05.808 --> 00:03:09.183
But they failed because
there wasn't consumer demand

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:09.849
for this.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.297
So we thought, okay, how can
we test this hypothesis?

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.025
You know, we were just a
bunch of college kids at

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:16.716
that time.

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:18.354
You know, we didn't own
trucks or

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:21.302
delivery infrastructures, or
anything like that, right.

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:25.270
We can't just spin up a
delivery company overnight.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.250
So, how can we test this
assumption we had?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.400
So we decided to create a
simple experiment

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.360
with restaurant delivery.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.630
We spent about an afternoon
just putting

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.820
together a really quick
landing page.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.930
And, when I went on the
internet,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.720
I found some PDF menus of,
you know,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.390
restaurants in Palo Alto
stuck it up there and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.740
then had a phone number at
the bottom, and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.160
which was our personal phone
number, actually.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.620
And that was it, we put up
the landing page,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.220
we called it
PaloAltoDelivery.com.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.930
And this is actually what it
looked like.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.080
You know, super, super, you
know, simple, ugly,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.080
like honestly, we weren't
really expecting anything.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.720
We just launched it.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.210
And all we wanted to see
was, you know,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.490
would we get phone calls
from this?

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.500
And if we got enough phone
calls, then maybe

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.360
this delivery idea was
something worth pursuing.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.480
So we put it up there,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.890
we weren't really expecting
anything, and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.790
we were driving back home.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.540
And all of a sudden we got a
phone call, you know?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.240
Someone called, they wanted
to order Thai food.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.560
And we're like, oh wow, this
is a real order.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.630
Like, you know,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.392
we have to do something
about it, right?

00:04:40.392 --> 00:04:45.960
So, so we were in our cars,
and we're, like,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.160
okay, like, we're not doing
anything right now.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.890
Might as well just, let's
just swing by, you know,

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.360
Siam Royal, pick up some Pad
Thai and

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.550
let's just deliver it to
this person, and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.330
let's try to learn how this
whole delivery thing works.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.850
And we did.
We

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.800
delivered to this guy up in
Alpine Road.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.523
I remember, he told us, I
was asking, oh,

00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:06.751
how did you hear about us?

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:07.910
What do you do?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.140
And he told us he was a
scholar.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.740
And then he handed me his
business card, and it

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.830
said he was the author of a
book called Weed the People.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.640
And that was like our first
ever delivery, right?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.215
It was like the best
delivery, first

00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:26.350
delivery/worst delivery you
could have asked for.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.530
You couldn't make this stuff
up.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.630
And, again, in the next day,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.640
we got, you know, two more
phone calls.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.230
But yet, the day after that,
we got five, and

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.270
then it became seven, and
then it became ten.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.590
And then, soon, we started
gaining traction on campus

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.110
with paloaltodelivery.com
which was pretty crazy.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.910
Because think about it,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.960
right, this was a landing
page.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.320
You have to look up PDF
menus to place your order,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.440
and they have to call in.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.580
This isn't exactly the most
professional looking site,

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.570
yet people were still, we
kept getting phone calls.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.310
We kept getting orders.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.970
And, that's kind of we knew
we were on to something,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.500
when people were willing.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.280
All right.
We

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.880
knew we found a need people
wanted,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.610
when people are willing to
put up with all this.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.930
So I think another key point
to remember is

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.330
we launched this in about an
hour, right.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.700
Like we didn't spend, you
know.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.320
We didn't have any drivers.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.520
We didn't have any
algorithms.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.809
We didn't spend, you know.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.610
We didn't have a back-end.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.570
We didn't spend 6 months

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.530
building like a fancy
dispatch system.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.800
We didn't have any of that.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.840
We just launched.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.990
Because at the beginning,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.650
none of that is necessary,
right?

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.710
At the beginning, it's all
about testing your idea,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.680
trying to get this thing off
the ground.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.780
And figuring out whether
this was

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.640
something people even
wanted.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.560
And it's okay to hack things
together at the beginning.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.610
At YC there's a mantra, we
like to

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.860
talk about is doing things
that don't scale.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.540
So at the beginning we were
the delivery drivers.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.140
Now, we would, you know, go
to class and

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.260
then after class we'll go,
you know, deliver food.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.860
We were the, you know,
custom support.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.270
Like, I sometimes had to

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.660
take phone calls during
lecture.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.430
We spent afternoons just
going down University Avenue

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.130
passing out flyers about,
kinda promote DoorDash.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.360
I mean, we didn't have any
dispatch systems.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.030
So what we had to do was,
you know,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.540
we used Square to charge all
of our customers.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.960
We used Google Docs to keep
track of our orders.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.400
we used Apple's Find My
Friends to keep track of

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.990
where all of our drivers
were.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.970
You know, stuff like that.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.940
Just figuring out like
what's,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.280
just hacking together
solutions,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.050
just trying to get this
thing off the ground.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.160
In fact, at one point we
were growing so fast that

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.810
Square actually shut our
account down because we

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.150
were under suspicions for
money laundering.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.440
>> Think about it, we were
getting small chunks of

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.290
like $15, $20 orders coming
in at a rapid pace.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.078
It was, yeah.

00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:06.965
Luckily, my co-founder Tony
worked at Square, so he just

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:13.267
e-mailed some buddies there
and everything was solved.

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:16.530
>> Yeah, and another thing
about doing

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.450
things that don't scale, is
that it also allows you to

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.850
become an expert in your
business.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.910
Right?
Like driving,

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.230
helps us understand how the
delivery process worked,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.880
you know.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.630
We used that as an
opportunity to talk to

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.560
customers, talk to our
restaurants.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.850
We did dispatching which
helped us figure out,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.990
you know, how we manually
dispatched every driver.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.300
And that helped us figure
out, you know,

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.290
what our driver assignment
algorithm should look like.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.670
We did customer support
ourselves, you know?

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.230
Getting real time feedback
from our customers.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.910
I remember, you know, for

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.170
the first few months when we
got started,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.780
we would manually e-mail
every single one of our

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.550
new customers.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.930
And at the end of every
night, and

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.060
just asking them oh,

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.200
how was your first delivery,
how did you hear about us?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.760
And we would personalize all
these e-mails, right?

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.610
Like if I see someone order
chicken skewers from

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.570
Oren's Hummus, I would say
oh,

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.450
like, I love Oren's hummus.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.680
You know, how were your
chicken skewers?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.300
How did the first delivery
went?

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.420
You know, just feedback like
that was really valuable and

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.413
customers really, really
appreciated that.

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:30.451
And I remember one time,

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:35.170
this is during YC, we were
out of, we just came out of

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.110
a meeting with one of our
restaurant partners, and,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.310
you know, we wanted, we
heard about this ice

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.410
cream store that just opened
up, you know,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.490
on University Avenue, called
Cream, and

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.200
we wanted to go try it out.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.410
And then, all of a sudden,
our co founder back at our,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.150
you know, office/house
texted us saying, oh we need

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.600
drivers on the road, we, we
got a huge spike and demand.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.430
So we debated for maybe, you
know,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.490
ten seconds like should we
go get ice cream or

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.500
should we go deliver?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.480
Obviously, we went and
delivered.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.490
But that kinda became our
motivation on,

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.910
you know, scaling, right.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.080
Like if we can scale then,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.340
you could go get ice cream
next time.

00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:18.800
So yeah, I think that kinda,
and now,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.860
of course, we've scaled up
across different cites.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.180
Now you have to worry about
building out

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.420
automated solutions and
dispatch systems, and

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.720
figuring out how do you
match demand and

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.070
supply, and all that fancy
technology stuff.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.280
But none of that mattered at
the beginning.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.130
Because at the beginning,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.490
it's all about getting this
thing off the ground and

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.030
trying to find product
market fit.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.010
So, just to summarize.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.220
So the three things I would
say that I learned from

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.810
doing DoorDash is first,
test your hypothesis,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.140
you wanna treat your startup
ideas like experiments.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.960
T he second thing is launch
fast.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.740
We launched in, you know,
less than an hour,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.260
where we released a full
landing page.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.750
And finally, it's okay to do
things that don't scale.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.850
Doing things that don't
scale is one of your biggest

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.820
competitive advantages when
you're starting out.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.090
And you can figure out how
to

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.180
scale once you have the
demand.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.560
And, maybe once you've
scaled,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.816
then you go get that ice
cream.

00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:16.098
Thanks.

00:11:20.817 --> 00:11:21.680
>> Sure.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:29.927
>> How did your first
customer hear about you?

00:11:29.927 --> 00:11:32.010
>> Yeah.
So the question was,

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.440
how did our first customer
hear about us?

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.220
Our very first one, I have
no idea.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.730
We just launched
PaloAltodelivery.com.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.660
We didn't do any marketing.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.010
So I assume he just must
have

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.980
typed in Palo Alto delivery
into the web browser.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.620
And then after that,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.620
we didn't do, we did barely
any marketing.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.000
I think I sent out like one
email to my dorm.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.028
And that was about it.

00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:56.680
It was all through word of
mouth and

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.059
that kind of just validates.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.790
You know, just how strong of
a need you found.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.330
You know, when people just
start talking about you and

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.930
they're willing to put up
with all this, you know,

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.710
terrible user experience,
terrible design, and

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.380
stuff like that.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.340
>> When you started, it
seemed so obvious that you

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.690
were wondering why no one's
done this.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.150
What's your answer now?

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.850
With that.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.220
>> Yeah, I mean, looking
back, I think,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:25.660
I think the biggest thing is
mobile.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.160
The fact that now everyone
has one of

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.470
those in their pocket.

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:34.010
And we kinda saw that trend
and thought, you now,

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.330
what if you can design, you
know, a delivery system

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.600
that's entirely based off
mobile, where you don't have

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.590
to have any infrastructure
or delivery fleets.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.470
Instead, you could, you
know,

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.910
instead of hiring drivers
full time,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.140
purchasing vehicles, what if
you can tap into a more

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.170
on demand pool of
independent contractors, and

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.930
only send orders to them
when they have time.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.630
So, that's kind of the, the
insight we had,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.450
we, everything was done
through mobile.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.150
Yeah.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.870
>> Did you know you were
gonna be a startup, or

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.240
just making some money on a
website, at first?

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.920
>> Yeah, I mean, at the time
we just wanted, we're all

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.100
really passionate about
building technology for

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.110
small business owners.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.850
And honestly, this delivery
things came out of

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.060
an experiment, right, with
the landing page.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.240
Like it was literally an
experiment.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.880
We didn't, we weren't
expecting anything and

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.350
it just took off, and we
went with it.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.610
And logistics was always
something we were

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.820
really passionate about as
well.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.940
You know like logistics,
transportation.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.420
It was kind of the perfect
fusion of, you know,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.550
how do you help small
business owners do delivery?

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.600
Back there.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.160
>> Do you launch the mobile
app first or the website?

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.183
And how long did it take
from idea to

00:13:52.183 --> 00:13:54.440
your first launch?

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.590
>> Yeah, we started with

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.390
this landing page right
here.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.670
Took us an hour to launch.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.390
>> How does DoorDash stand
out in

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:13.612
a space filled with and
other companies.

00:14:13.612 --> 00:14:17.150
>> Yeah, the question was
how does DoorDash stand out

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.890
among a very competitive
space.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.940
I mean, at the beginning, I
mean for us, consumer demand

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.080
has never been the problem,
even up until now.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.350
So, for us it's just about,
you know, finding a need and

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.140
just focusing on serving
that demand.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.446
So, in the beginning,
competition doesn't really

00:14:34.446 --> 00:14:36.144
matter when you're getting
started.

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:46.579
>> Yeah, question was how
long it took for

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:48.640
us to incorporate into a
company?

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.451
When we went through YC.

00:14:49.451 --> 00:14:52.053
So, we launched in January
2013, and

00:14:52.053 --> 00:14:54.941
then we did YC that very
summer, and we, when we

00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:58.439
decided to take this idea
through YC, we incorporated.

00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:06.209
>> One more?

00:15:06.209 --> 00:15:07.550
Yeah you.
>> What do

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.660
you plan to do next, or
where do you plan to go

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.560
with this besides like food
delivery?

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.490
>> Yeah I mean, the question
was where do we plan to

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.930
go beyond food delivery?

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.120
I mean for us, when we
started door dash it

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.320
was always like I said
about.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.750
Helping small business
owners and

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.990
figuring out, how do you
service for

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.530
any local merchant, whether
you are a Macaron store or

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.840
a restaurant or a furniture
shop.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.130
I mean, that's still our
focus,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.360
that's like the long-term
vision.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.870
For now we're just focused
on rush on

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.240
delivery as a way to scale,
but

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.256
ultimately that's where we
want it end up in.

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:45.952
>> Cool.

00:15:45.952 --> 00:15:46.988
>> Thanks.

00:15:54.097 --> 00:15:57.388
>> Okay, next is Walker
Williams from Teespring,

00:15:57.388 --> 00:16:00.222
Teespring at the YC, you're
in Africa?

00:16:00.222 --> 00:16:01.530
>> Yeah.
>> I almost rejected them.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.030
Sounds like a dumb idea but

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.980
now they're doing hundreds
of millions of

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.450
dollars a year of revenue so
very lucky to have him.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.355
And Walker's gonna talk also

00:16:10.355 --> 00:16:12.520
about doing things
non-scale.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.500
>> All right.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.980
Thank you guys for having
me.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.000
My name is Walker.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.620
I'm the CEO and founder of
Teespring, for

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.156
those of you guys who don't
know what Teespring is.

00:16:23.156 --> 00:16:26.160
We're an e-commerce platform
that allows entrepreneurs to

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.850
launch products and

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:31.830
apparel brands without
risks, costs or compromise.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.680
Today the company is about
180 folks and

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.460
we ship tens of thousands of
products each day,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.720
and I wanna talk to you
about one of the most

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.135
fundamental advantages you
have as a start-up and

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:48.020
that's you're able to do
things that don't scale, and

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.410
I define things that don't
scale as things that

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.420
are sort of fundamentally
unsustainable.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.380
They will not last,

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.200
they will not bring in the
millionth user and

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.400
where they break, it's
usually time, but

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.670
it could be a number of
other things.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.480
But it's really growth

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.130
strategies that won't take
you to a million users and

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.450
there's three real places I
wanna focus on today.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.820
First one is finding your
first users.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.090
The second one is turning
those users into champions,

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.460
and the third one is finding
your product and market fit.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.050
So finding your first users,
the first thing you have to

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.790
understand is that there is
no silver bullet for

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.670
user acquisition.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.280
Everybody and this includes
me when we got started,

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.400
you look for that, that
dream solution,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.330
that pay-per-click campaign
that has tremendous ROI.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.200
Some accelerating
partnership that's gonna

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.030
springboard you into the
stratosphere, an affiliate

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.490
agreement, something that
solves it for you.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.810
But the reality is for

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.240
the vast majority of
companies and

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.110
in fact, for every company
that I've had the chance to

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.900
speak to CEO of, that's just
not possible.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.290
Those are unicorns and

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.620
most of the companies that
from the outside look

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.260
like they've had this dream
growth curve.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.810
The reality is that those
first users were impossibly

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.485
hard to get and let me tell
you about

00:18:04.485 --> 00:18:08.280
the story of a ridiculously
unsustainable business.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.490
So, this is teespring in
2012.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:16.070
When we first got, when we
first launched the business

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.270
couldn't have looked worse
it took days of meetings.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.330
We had to offer free design
and

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.000
days of revisions back and
forth.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.870
We'd have to launch the
product ourselves.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.770
We'd have to do the social
media.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.124
All the sell like 50 shirts
for a local non-profit, and

00:18:30.124 --> 00:18:32.247
generate $1,000 of revenue,

00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:34.880
anybody looking in would
have said.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.330
You guys need to give up,
this is a terrible idea.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.450
But as time went on, those
users started to

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.100
add up and I think something
you have to

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.940
understand is that when you
first launch a company,

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.900
just by virtue of the fact
that it's a new product,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.570
you're gonna be bad at
selling it, right?

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.610
You've got no idea what the
paying points of customers

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.260
really are.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.550
You've never sold it before.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.610
You don't have any success
stories to point to or

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.880
testimonials.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.650
Those first users are always
going to be the hardest, and

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.660
so it's your responsibility
as a founder to do

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.290
whatever it takes to bring
in your first users and

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.548
it's gonna be different for
every company.

00:19:14.548 --> 00:19:18.110
The common thread that I
hear is founders need to

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.890
spend personal time and
effort.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.320
A lot of their personal time
and

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.675
effort to bring those users
in themselves,

00:19:23.675 --> 00:19:25.900
it can mean a number of
thing.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.830
Everything from sending 100
emails a day, getting on

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.770
the phone and just calling
as many people as you can,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.870
going through a network,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.150
if you have a network like
Standford or Y Combinator.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.820
Anything you can do to get
that first user and I really

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.730
equate it to pushing a
boulder up a hill and

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.820
if you think of like a very
sort of smooth hill,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.010
when you get started.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:52.380
The incline is the steepest
in those first inches are

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.770
the hardest and over time as
you get farther and farther.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.020
The incline stays out, it
gets easier and

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.220
hopefully, eventually you
reached a point where you're

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.280
at the top of the hill and
the boulder starts to

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.710
roll on its own, and so
those first users,

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.330
you just cannot focus on ROI
in the sense of time.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.880
Do not expect to spend an
hour and

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.230
return thousands of dollars.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.190
Maybe Stanley is one of
those unicorns that was

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.560
a pretty incredible story.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.090
But for most of us those
first users

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.910
are going to take a lot of a
hand holding, a lot of

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.450
personal love and that's
okay, that's essential for

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.150
building a company, and the
one sort of caveat of that

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.670
is that I don't recommend
giving away your product for

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.460
free and there's plenty of
exceptions to this rule.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:41.270
But in general cutting costs
or giving the product away

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.730
is an unsustainable strategy
I wouldn't recommend.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.040
You need to make sure that
users value your product and

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.990
people have a different,
they treat products that

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.910
are free in a much different
way than a paid product and

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.980
often times it can give you
a false sense of security if

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.620
oh, we're getting all these
users surely we

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.810
can convert them over to
paid.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.580
The second aspect is what
happens when you get those

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.580
users, how do you turn those
users into champions and

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.870
a champion is a user who
talks about and

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.540
advocates for your product.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.050
And I'm a firm believer that
every company with a great

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.950
growth strategy has users
who are champions and so

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.370
really the easiest way to
build.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.180
Turn a user in to a champion
is to delight them with

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.910
an experience their gonna
remember so

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.920
something that's unusual or

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.970
out of the ordinary an
exceptional experience and

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.290
the easiest way to do this
early and

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.570
again something that is
completely unsustainable,

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.140
it's not gonna scale forever
is to just talk to

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.450
those users and people will
say this all the time,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:46.960
and you hear it.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.775
It's one of the sort of core
tenants of why

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:52.740
combinators talk to users
but I cannot stress

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.620
how important it is that you
spend a large chunk of your

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.400
time talking to users, and
you should do it constantly,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.800
every single day and as long
as possible.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
Today at Teespring,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.840
I'm still the catch all
email address, so

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.400
anytime somebody misspells
support or writes an email

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.030
address that doesn't exist,
I get that email, and so

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.770
I still do about 12 to 20
customer service tickets

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.910
every single day.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.740
I spend hours each night
reading every single tweet,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.600
probably a little bit OCD,
but that's okay.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.920
I read through all the
Teespring communities.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.110
You're never gonna get a
better sense for

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.230
your product than actually
listening to real users, and

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.010
especially in the early
days, you're just,

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.440
the products you launch
with, and

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.400
the features set you launch
with, is almost certainly

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.370
not going to be the feature
set that you scale with and

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.080
the quicker you talk to
users and

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.010
learn what they actually
need,.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.480
The faster you can get to
that point.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.550
So there's three ways to
talk to your customers,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.540
you can run customer service
yourself,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:01.110
up until Teespring was doing
about $130-$140,000 a month

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.580
my co-founder Evan and

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.360
I did everything in customer
service.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.660
This is one that there's
gonna be an instinct to

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.000
quickly pass off and that's
because it's painful.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.990
Even today, when I open our
customer service

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.590
portal, I have like an
emotional reaction where my

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.060
stomach sinks because it
sucks talking to users

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.830
who have had a terrible
experience and it's painful.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.790
It's something that you love
and you put so

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.260
much effort into and you've
gotten it wrong or

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.800
they've had a terrible
experience or

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.000
somebody didn't treat them
right.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.010
But it's so important that
you go through that and

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.620
learn what you need to
build, what you need to fix.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.160
The second step is to
proactively reach out

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.030
to current and churned
customers and

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.630
churned customers are
customers who have left, and

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:50.330
this is one that often falls
by the wayside in sort of.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:54.850
The pursuit of new customers
but you wanna make sure that

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.190
your customers are having a
consistent, good experience.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.300
You don't wanna just leave
those current users as

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.400
sort of, you don't want take
them for granted and

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.290
then when a user actually
leaves your service,.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.170
You wanna reach out and

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.750
find out why both because
that personal outreach can

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:13.210
make the difference between
leaving and staying.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.880
Sometimes people just need
to know that you care and

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.648
it's going to get better and

00:24:17.648 --> 00:24:21.460
because even if you can't
bring them back

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.350
there's a chance that you
can learn from the mistake

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.930
that you made that caused
them to leave and fix it so

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.840
you don't churn users out
the same way in the future.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.480
And the final one is, again,

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.810
the one that I'm probably
too OCD about, but

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.860
it's social media and
communities.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.630
You need to know how

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:37.760
people are talking about
your brand.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.070
You need to reach out and
make sure that,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.830
when somebody does have a
bad experience and

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.940
they're talking about it,
that you make it right.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.720
Problems are inevitable in
start-ups,

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.610
there's gonna be issues,

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.120
you're not gonna have the
perfect product,

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.770
things are gonna break,
things are gonna go wrong.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.330
That's not important, what's
important is to

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:02.070
always make it right, to
always go the extra mile and

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.750
make that customer happy.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:06.430
One detractor who has had a
terrible experience on your

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.870
platform is enough to
reverse the progress of

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.030
ten champions.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.840
It's all it takes is one
person out there to say, no.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.540
You shouldn't use those guys
for X, Y, and

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.920
Z reason, to ruin a ton of
momentum.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.680
So even if it's there's
examples in the early

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.070
days where we would mess up
massive orders.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.980
We would print the colors
slightly wrong,

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.670
it would be the wrong size
and

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.260
it would be like half of our
GMV for

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.550
that month and we would know
we got it wrong.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.390
The customer would be
unhappy and

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.570
sort of this instinct is
well, it's only a little bit

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.360
off or it's not completely
wrong it'll be fine.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.190
But the reality is you've
just got to bite the bullet

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.050
and make sure that's it
right, and those customers,

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.650
the customers that are often
originally the most

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.260
frustrated tend to turn into
the biggest champions and

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.479
the longest term users.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.410
And the last one I

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:59.410
wanna talk about is finding
product and market fit and

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.790
what I mean that is that I
mentioned this earlier.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.550
But the product you launch
with will almost certainly

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:11.090
not be the product that
takes you to scale and so

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.470
you're job in those early
moments or

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.450
those early days of a
start-up.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:20.270
Is to progress and iterate
as fast as possible to reach

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.440
that product that does have
market fit and as engineers

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.250
you're instinct is gonna be
to build a platform with

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.090
beautiful clean code that
scales right?

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.239
You don't wanna write sort
of duct tape code that's

00:26:33.239 --> 00:26:35.590
gonna pile on technical
debt.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.710
But you need to optimize for
speed over scalability and

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.380
clean code and sort of an
example of this is,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.790
in the early days,

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.870
we had a couple enterprise
customers come to us.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.960
Sort of bigger non-profits
and

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.980
say, hey, we really like
your service but

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.650
you're missing these
fundamental things.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.740
So we can't, we're not gonna
use it and we looked at sort

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.120
of what it would take to
build out those features and

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.920
we weren't sure they were
gonna work long-term, but

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.378
we wanted to try it.

00:27:01.378 --> 00:27:05.860
And my co-founder Evan who
is our CTO and a million

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.680
times better developer than
I am, sort of run the map

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.470
and figured out that if we
did it the right way.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.150
It was gonna take about a
month to build out

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.130
these features and

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.770
in a start-up, a month you
live in dog years.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.240
A month is a year and that
just wasn't gonna do.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.480
So he actually went out,
duplicated the code base,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.970
duplicated the database and
was able to

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.840
basically build a completely
different product that he

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.280
didn't have to worry about
the existing users for,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.180
to serve these enterprise
customers.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.500
We gave them the tool,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.570
they on-boarded, they
generate a lot of revenue.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.210
Eventually, we learned what
features were core and

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.290
we integrated them into the
core product, but

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.940
what would have taken a
month,

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.730
we were able to do in three
to four days.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.748
A great rule of thumb is to
only worry about the next

00:27:51.748 --> 00:27:53.930
order of magnitude.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.880
So when you have your tenth
user, you shouldn't be

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.210
wondering, well, how are we
gonna serve a million users.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:02.040
You should be worried about
how are we gonna get to 100?

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.560
When you're at 100, you
should think about 1,000.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.090
It's one of those things
where necessity is

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:08.830
the mother of invention of
all inventions.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.710
So, when you hit that
breaking point, like

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:15.320
the Twitter Fail Whale is a
great example and Teespring.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.330
There were months, month
stretches where

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.630
every single night, the site
would crash, every night and

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.660
during the day and every
single person on the team

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.830
would go to sleep with their
phone on loud under their

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.040
pillow so that inevitably,
when the buzzer went off,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.920
we could quickly get up,
restart the servers and

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.260
go back to sleep and this
would happen daily.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.610
But the reality is that it
was worth it and

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.230
you'll end up with these
huge pain points and

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.955
all this technical debt and
regret.

00:28:41.955 --> 00:28:46.400
But it's worth it, just to
get to that end goal and

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.970
that product fit faster, you
will make it work,

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:54.490
you will survive that those
sort of bumps are just speed

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.810
bumps and speed is so, so
important early.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.470
So, the lesson that I've
been learning lately is

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.510
you want to do these things
that don't scale as long

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.210
as possible.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.090
There's not some magical
moment,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.080
it's not the series A, it's
not when you hit a certain

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.810
revenue milestone that you
stop doing things that

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:15.800
don't scale.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.620
This is one of your biggest
advantages as a company,

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.510
and the moment you give it
up.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.420
You're giving your
competitors that are smaller

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.540
that can still do things,
that advantage over you.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.730
So, as long as humanly
possible,

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.180
as long as it is a net
positive,

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.870
you need to be spending time
talking to your users.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.440
You need to move fast in
development,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.420
as fast as possible.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.260
But don't give it up
willingly, it should be

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.772
ripped from you, and so sort
of trying to practice what I

00:29:42.772 --> 00:29:45.712
preach I wanna give you guys
my email address.

00:29:45.712 --> 00:29:47.271
If you guys have any
questions,

00:29:47.271 --> 00:29:49.062
if you wanna learn about
Teespring,

00:29:49.062 --> 00:29:51.720
if you wanna print some
t-shirts, fingers crossed,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.903
just shoot me an email.

00:29:52.903 --> 00:29:56.225
I'd love to help and I'd
love to speak to you.

00:29:56.225 --> 00:29:59.015
And the last thing is we've
created an official how to

00:29:59.015 --> 00:30:01.380
start a start up tee with
Sam.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.140
And all proceeds are going
to Watsi.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.460
I couldn't miss this
opportunity to sell.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.570
So if you guys wanna grab
one of the official tees,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:11.510
just go to
teespring.com/startup and

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:12.724
it's supporting a great
cause.

00:30:12.724 --> 00:30:15.848
Thank you.

00:30:20.536 --> 00:30:22.100
Sure.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.840
Go ahead.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.669
Yep.
The T-shirt printing

00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:31.468
business, it seems like it
has a lot of So what made

00:30:31.468 --> 00:30:33.643
you, what convinced you, to
think this is a viable

00:30:33.643 --> 00:30:36.082
market even with all that's
going on in the world today?

00:30:36.082 --> 00:30:38.250
Sure.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.390
You know, so the question
was, the T-shirt printing

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.350
business has a lot of
competition.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.550
What would convince us to
get into the market?

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.310
I think there's two factors
to it.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.530
So first, I completely
agree.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.940
From the outside, people
have been telling us

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.950
that this is a silly idea
since day one.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.980
And sort of that every order
of magnitude we reach,

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.180
people will come and say
hey, that's a terrible,

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.370
terrible idea why are you
doing that?

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.370
But the reason that we
launched Teespring is

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.020
because we ran into a
personal pain point where we

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.830
had a need and we looked at
the current solutions.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.090
I was a student at Brown,
and

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.770
I was trying to create a
remember the bar shirt for

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.720
a dive bar that got shut
down.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.788
And I realized that nothing
needed,

00:31:19.788 --> 00:31:21.960
nothing matched my needs.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.310
And so, because I knew that
I had that pain point.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.790
And I knew there was market
fit and

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.020
I had seen people adopt the
product.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.900
I knew there was something
there and

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.720
it was also one of those
things where you,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.050
you can sort of feel the,
you can sort of

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.370
feel the wind on your back
where people are adopting

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.900
the product quickly, the
pain point is clearly there.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.320
It's not a met need.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.100
So, I would say that
oftentimes great ideas start

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.850
by looking like silly ideas.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.960
And then you can sort of
feel out whether or

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.910
not there's a scalable
business here by how people

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.980
are adopting it.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.988
Is it possible to bring
customers aboard?

00:31:56.988 --> 00:31:57.749
Sure.

00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:02.840
Are non-profits your biggest
customer base, like?

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.110
No.
You know, today our

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.430
biggest customer base are
entrepreneurs who

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.860
are trying to build brands
and businesses.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.510
You know, we have a little
over a 1,000 people that

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.710
make their full time living
on

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.490
Teespring today via brands
they've launched and

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.150
the other side is
influencers,

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:22.990
so YouTube stars, Reddit
communities, bloggers who

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.700
want to add product
merchandise as a way to sort

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.950
of create a brand and and
monetize that affinity.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.490
So those are our two biggest
markets.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.360
We still do work with a lot
of non-profits and

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.780
love working with them.

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.420
It's still a part of

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.520
our business just not the
majority.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.200
Thank you.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.700
Yeah.

00:32:44.163 --> 00:32:45.624
All right, now we'll have
Justin talk.

00:32:45.624 --> 00:32:48.669
Justin was the founder of
KeyCo, and then JustinTV,

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:52.674
which Twitch and is now and
he's going to talk about PR.

00:32:59.591 --> 00:33:00.870
Cool.
Well, while I wait for

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.790
the slide to happen, I
started a bunch of startups

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.460
but I think you've heard a
lot of awesome, you know,

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.900
kind of how did I get
started stories.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.180
So I'm gonna talk about
something very specific,

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.770
that people always have
questions with,

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.560
which is press and how do
you get it.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.060
How does it work?

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.980
It's something, this is kind
of like an abridged

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.910
version of what we talked
about at Y Combinator and

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.620
hopefully you guys will find
it helpful.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.560
So, you know, a lot of
people,

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.840
I think when they first get
started with

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.090
entrepreneurship think about
getting press and being in

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.760
the press as something that
happens magically.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.520
They think about it as like
something that,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.620
you know, journalists out
there like,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.090
trying to find the best
stories and

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:41.910
really, you know, like,
discover the,

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.520
like, it's like a
meritocracy which is like,

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.909
absolutely not the case.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.360
So before you think about
press, one of the things you

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.890
really want to think about
is who you want to reach and

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.630
like what's you actual goal.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.170
Right?
A lot of people,

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.470
like I know when I got
started I

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.850
wanted to just be in the
news because I

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.470
thought that's what like you
did as an important company.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.440
And it turns out if you
don't have any goals

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.510
you're not gonna achieve
them.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.600
Right?
I mean that's true of

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.570
pretty much everything and
with press,

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.930
if you just like, aimlessly
want to be covered,

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.910
it's not really going to do
anything for your start up.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.500
So getting like, in the news
is nice because you can send

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.890
it to your mom or your, and
say hey, I have a real job.

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.420
You know, look, we're in the
New York Times.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.990
But if you don't have a
actual goal for

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.320
your, like a business goal
with it,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.550
it's really just like, not a
good use of time.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.940
So, you know, there's many
different goals.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.240
One example is, you know,
you might want to,

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:36.780
with Social Cam, which is a
spin off of Justin TV,

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.493
it was like an app that was
kind of

00:34:39.493 --> 00:34:40.943
like video Instagram.

00:34:40.943 --> 00:34:44.390
And our goal was really to
be known as a video,

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:45.600
like Instagram app, and

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.860
like be thought of in that
context when it was,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.940
you know, time to pitch to
our,

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.176
like Silicon Valley
investors and influencers.

00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:55.410
And so, we really wanted to
get in, like tech press and

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:59.242
kind of be positioned as
this new, hot social app.

00:34:59.242 --> 00:35:04.390
With Exec, one of my goals
was a second,

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.430
like to get customers.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.580
So, Exec was like,

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.440
a cleanings, local cleaning
service and

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.830
our goal was to get people
in San Francisco to use it.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.394
It wasn't like useful to get
the national press because,

00:35:15.394 --> 00:35:17.710
you know, 99% of those
people couldn't use it.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.600
So, we really targeted
initially a lot of,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.430
you know, like SF Chronicle,

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:24.720
and like local San Francisco
press that would directly

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.632
talk to people who could
potentially use our app.

00:35:26.632 --> 00:35:30.360
For Twitch which is probably
the thing that you

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.710
guys mostly know.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.420
It was you know, Twitch was
ESPN for gaming or kind of

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.500
like a live streaming
community of gamers.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.950
And our goal was to with
press was like to

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.500
reach the gaming industry.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.130
Cuz like when we started now
it's like 55 million

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:45.980
uniques and

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.780
like people in the gaming
industry know about it.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.810
But when we started nobody
really knew that like,

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.170
it was a place to advertise,
and

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:54.600
like, it wasn't like know as
like a, you know,

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.350
we were a very nascent small
gaming community.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.190
And our goal was to like get
people in

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.060
the gaming industry, whether
they were developers or

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.230
advertisers, to think about
us as like

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.170
an important place where
influences were, so

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:08.330
we really targeted industry
trades and game depth logs.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.730
Places where like gamers
wanna have games speed,

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.560
stuff like that, the
industry was reading.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.100
So, you know,

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.210
what's an actual story, I
think there's, you know,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.560
there's a bunch of different
types of stories but

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.346
these are usually the ones
that you see in,

00:36:23.346 --> 00:36:26.030
you know, start ups.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.170
Those are like product
launches,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.610
like you let us launch a new
version of your app.

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.780
There's fundraising for

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.000
whatever reason, you know,
press loves to write about

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.390
fundraising even though it's
not very interesting.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.660
So, you know like, if you
raise a $1 million

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:41.030
seaground, pretty much you
can get that covered.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.205
Milestones or metrics like
you've achieved a $1 million

00:36:44.205 --> 00:36:49.110
dollars a week in revenue,
that one of our, the,

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.440
the company that bought Exec
just announced that they,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.390
they achieved a $1 million
dollars a week in

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.700
revenue and was covered
pretty widely.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.646
Business stories which
generally happen when

00:36:58.646 --> 00:37:01.220
you're already a successful
company.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.355
Someone like New York Times
or New Yorker, business

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:08.530
magazine will wanna cover
the story of your start up.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.030
Usually don't have to worry
about that in the beginning.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.160
What I like to call stunts,
which are like,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.520
I don't know if you guys
remember, but

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.320
a couple of years ago, this
YC company called WePay

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.120
dropped a block of ice with
money frozen in it, outside

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.680
of the PayPal like, a PayPal
developers conference.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.860
Cuz they were like, PayPal
was like no, in the news for

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.560
freezing, you know, like
various developers accounts.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.190
And so that was like, you
know, widely covered.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.890
Because it was just so,

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.125
you know, kinda of an
interesting thing and

00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:40.060
it really, it got them in
the story, right?

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.180
They wouldn't have been
talked about in

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.862
the context of PayPal, at
all really.

00:37:43.862 --> 00:37:45.360
Hiring announcements,

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.350
if you're a big enough
company and

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.771
you hire someone really
important,

00:37:47.771 --> 00:37:49.200
people will wanna cover
that, and

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.180
then contributed articles
like you writing some sort

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.240
of industry overview or some
opinion piece in like

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.830
maybe a tech blog or stuff
like that.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.610
So those are like, you know,

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.870
basically any of those
things can be stories.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.620
One of the things that
people usually don't

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.740
think about.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.180
Is that, like, you really
have to think about,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.090
like, everything, when you
start a start up,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.800
you think that everything
you're doing is interesting.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.370
But that's not true for,
like, other people.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.380
Right?
Like, what you really need

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.800
to think about is, like,
objectively if I

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.570
wasn't the founder of this
company, would I wanna,

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.970
like, read a story about
what I'm pitching.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.250
Right?
So, you know,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:30.270
you have incremental feature
release or 2.01, you know,

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.740
feature release might not be
interesting.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.950
Just because you added like,

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.070
you know, find your contacts
in Facebook or something.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.510
Like you have, you really
want to take a step

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.580
back before you invest the
time in like actually trying

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.950
to pitch a story and think,
does anyone,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:45.880
will anyone actually wanna
read this?

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.790
Because what people are, you
know, journalist and

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:48.730
bloggers are looking for,

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.529
is things that people
actually wanna read right?

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.090
The other thing is like,

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:54.750
you don't actually have to
be very original.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.630
Your press in these doesn't
have to be original.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.840
It just has to be like what
I like to call,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.820
original enough, right?

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.386
So you don't wanna be the
second cooler company

00:39:05.386 --> 00:39:07.980
To raise $5 million on
Kickstarter, right?

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:08.700
That's like.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.780
That the first guy gets all
the news.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.320
But like if you're there,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.770
I think the first video game
console to

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.080
raise $10 million on
Kickstarter like Ouya was,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.082
that was like, it was like
$1 million is 24 hours.

00:39:20.082 --> 00:39:22.050
That was huge news because
they

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.240
were kinda like the first in
that category, right?

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.500
Even though other people
have raised a lot of

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.700
money on Kickstarter before.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.150
So just like think about
your stories in

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.030
the context of like where
they are in

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.970
the like what else has been
written about and if

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.630
they're like kind of novel
enough and they haven't been

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.183
something that was like just
written about in the news.

00:39:41.183 --> 00:39:44.406
So what are the actual
mechanics of

00:39:44.406 --> 00:39:46.940
getting a story?

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.560
This is like pretty
tactical,

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.680
so what if you want to get
your news in, you know,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.510
the press, basically there's
some easy, simple steps.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.710
So it's basically, it's,
getting press is like,

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:02.120
you think of it like a sales
funnel.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.600
So you're gonna talk to a
lot of people,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.960
and not all of them are
gonna convert.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.810
Right?
And so

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.950
you shouldn't be upset when
someone,

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.120
like one individual person
or reporter or

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.500
whatever doesn't write your
story.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.210
The first thing is you have
to think of a story, right?

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.280
It's gotta be one of those,

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.370
probably one of those things
that I listed up before.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.450
The second step is,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:24.130
you wanna get introduced to
a reporter or multiple

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.791
reporters who are gonna
write about your thing.

00:40:25.791 --> 00:40:27.829
It's like much, much easier,

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:30.697
just like any sort of
business development to

00:40:30.697 --> 00:40:33.883
actually get in touch with
them through someone.

00:40:33.883 --> 00:40:37.590
It's like, you know, rather
than cold emailing them,

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:40.520
the best thing to do I've
found is like, you wanna

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.130
go to entrepreneurs who were
just written about,

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:44.690
like your friends who maybe
started a start up and

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.850
they were covered on
TechCrunch,

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:49.740
get them to introduce you to
your, you know,

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.990
that reporter who wrote
about them.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.190
The reason that's good is
because like,

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.730
from the entrepreneur's
perspective, like

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.880
the easiest thing to do in
the world, is introduce you

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.200
to a reporter who already
wrote about them, right?

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.480
They don't, like need
anything else from

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.700
that reporter.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.220
They're actually doing that
person a favor for

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.040
stories interesting.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.020
It's not like you're asking
for

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.710
interest to investors, or
potential, you know,

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.421
people that they would wanna
hire, employees.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.130
And then, from the
reporter's perspective,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.790
they're getting intro to
someone who, you know,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.280
they already vetted as
interesting.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.200
Like, they're getting an
answer from someone who

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.860
they know they

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.460
thought was interesting
enough to talk about.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.540
And so, like by the
transitive property

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.600
you're basically gonna,
they're gonna think you're,

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.650
you know, probably
interesting.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.520
So you get like an email
that's like,

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.780
you know, from this guy that
introduces you to

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.300
the reporter, and

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.480
you want to get in contact
with them with enough time

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.200
that you can actually get
them to like write a story.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.920
Probably a week in advance,
or more.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.680
Because they're not gonna,
like, drop everything their

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.890
doing to just write about
your news.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.755
So, a lot of people,
especially first time

00:41:50.755 --> 00:41:51.990
entrepreneurs will come and
say,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.430
like, Justin I'm watching
this product tomorrow.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.210
Like, can you get me in
this, you know,

00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:58.120
TechCrunch or something.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.090
And that's, like, probably
not gonna happen unless you

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:01.440
already have a relationship.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.640
The best way to do it, so
the best thing to do is,

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.850
like, give yourself some
lead time.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.562
Get that intro in advance.

00:42:06.562 --> 00:42:09.725
And then, so then you
should,

00:42:09.725 --> 00:42:12.350
like, once you've set a date
for your news to go out,

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.100
you're gonna launch your
product, like in two weeks,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.050
you have this intro, you set
up some sort of meeting and

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.260
you really wanna get the
reporter to,

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.440
like, invest time and effort
into you.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.240
Because they don't,

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.670
like there's kind of a
sunk-cost fallacy at play.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:30.210
Basically if you,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:33.090
the more time they spend
with you, the more likely

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.400
they are to like actually
write something.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.340
So you, the best thing to do
is to get a face to

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:36.940
face meeting.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:40.170
Lots of people, report
bloggers actively don't want

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.702
to meet you face to face.

00:42:41.702 --> 00:42:44.500
But like, if not that, then
get like a phone call,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.660
right, and get on the phone
with them.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.710
The worse thing to do is
like,

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:48.990
just have an email exchange,
right?

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.820
Because it's very easy for

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.860
them to like forget about
it, ignore it.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.300
So you wanna like, actually
try to get in contact with

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.830
them, set up a meeting.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.230
Okay.
So, then

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.430
the next step is actually
pitch them.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.970
What I usually do is
actually write out all

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.940
my new, like the story that
I would want to see

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.300
published like in bullet
points.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.020
And I like, will write out
the story,

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.130
like my ideal story and I
will memorize it.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:19.160
Like the entire like set of
bullet points and when I

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.670
have a conversation with
them, if it's in person,

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.530
I'll like walk them through
this, like I'll have

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.560
a conversation that's like
structured like my outline.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.750
And they'll be like taking
notes, right?

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.440
And then they'll go and

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.210
transcribe those notes into
a story.

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.970
And so it's like a tell it,
like what I wrote will

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:36.180
eventually be translated
into a actual story.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.810
And, you know, by preparing
you can actually you know,

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.660
much more easily control the
conversation and

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.890
not forget critical things
like, you know,

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:45.720
your co-founder, mentioning
your co-founder's name.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.760
Or like,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.570
what all the features in
your awesome app are.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.880
If it's, I'm doing this on
the phone, I will like,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.490
have this bullet points in
front of me and

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:56.300
I will make sure to like
walk through

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.499
a conversation that includes
all of those things.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.090
So, you know, you do that,
they,

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.960
you have a pitch, they, they
take notes.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.380
They're gonna write the
story of this time.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.320
And then, the next thing is
like, follow up,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.580
like a couple days, or day
before your actual news goes

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.870
out, you want to send them
an email that says, like.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.000
You know, this is the time
we're launching the app.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.655
Like, thanks for meeting,
here's like collateral like

00:44:21.655 --> 00:44:23.950
maybe if you have like a
video or photos or

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:26.770
something you want them to
include screen shots.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.330
Like how to spell your
co-founders' names and

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.235
your name.

00:44:29.235 --> 00:44:30.910
Just like include all the
information that I

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:32.570
really care about and I bold
it right?

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.210
And then that's it.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.570
Then hopefully the day comes
you press submit on

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.754
the release to the app store
and

00:44:41.754 --> 00:44:44.946
at the same time they
release their article on

00:44:44.946 --> 00:44:47.219
TechCrunch and you are
famous.

00:44:49.939 --> 00:44:54.930
Okay, so a lot of people ask
us about PR firms.

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.795
so.

00:44:55.795 --> 00:44:57.473
You know, I think in the
beginning.

00:44:57.473 --> 00:44:59.741
It's kind of like everything
else you do at a start,

00:44:59.741 --> 00:45:00.354
you want to do it

00:45:00.354 --> 00:45:02.790
yourself before you hire
someone else to do it.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.720
And it's actually pretty
easy,

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.800
especially with tech press
who,

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.230
you know, and bloggers who,

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.780
like, constantly need new
things to write about.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.850
You know.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.240
I strongly encourage people
to, like,

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.470
try it themselves and kind
of get started by learning

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.590
the process themselves
before they hire anyone.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.050
One thing I'll say is that
like firms can,

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.800
can only help you with like
kind of the contacts and

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.560
the logistics, but it can't
help you

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.010
know what's interesting
about your company or very,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.990
you know, I've never had
anyone whose been able to

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.740
tell me what the stories
that I'm producing are.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.730
They've only been able to
tell me,

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:35.130
you know, like you're you
know, like here's a the,

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.000
here's a list of reporters
that you might wanna contact

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.260
So, you know, you really
have to be responsible for

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.190
thinking about like,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:42.370
what's interesting about
your company and

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.130
what are you doing, you
know, what's the road map of

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.000
interesting things that
you're working on.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.330
They're also really
expensive.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.437
You know, I think we were
spending between $5,000 and

00:45:51.437 --> 00:45:54.760
$20,000 a month which is
like a very, for

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.710
various firms that's a lot
for a start up, right?

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.900
You should, it's generally.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.100
Not a good use of money, I
would say.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.350
Especially in the very early
days.

00:46:04.973 --> 00:46:08.410
You know, getting press is,
is a lot of work.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:10.620
So you should really make
sure it's worth it.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.810
You know, like I said it
really,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.650
getting press doesn't mean,
it feels like,

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:15.740
it's like a vanity metric.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.970
Right?
It feels like you're being

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.020
successful because lots of
succesful companies.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.720
You know, like Google and

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.660
Facebook, are covered in the
press all the time.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.100
But it doesn't actually mean
you're successful.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.140
It doesn't, you know,
actually give you, you know,

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.670
mean that you're getting,
you're making money,

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.550
you're getting users, you're
making those users happy.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.780
it's, you know,

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:33.500
sometimes it's a really good
strategy for

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.480
getting your first 100, or
200, or 1,000 customers.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.690
But it's really not a
scalable user acquisition

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.800
strategy, so it's something
that's really just like a,

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.280
you know, a boot strap.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:43.850
You can't, like,

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:47.268
just get, like, infinity
articles written about you.

00:46:47.268 --> 00:46:48.440
Like, eventually people are
going to,

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.470
like, get tired of hearing
about your company, and

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.570
usually that happens pretty,
pretty quickly, right.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.120
The whole point about news
is that it's new, and so

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.150
it's, it's pretty, pretty,
pretty hard, unless your

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.160
Google, to get covered in
the press like every week,

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.800
you know, with something.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.410
to, you know, if you decide
it's worth it though,

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.970
like you do wanna have like
a regular heartbeat of news.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:09.510
So that's like something
where, you know,

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:11.430
you're planning out those
types of the, what,

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.970
your thing about what your
doing, that matches those,

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:17.150
you know, maybe seven story
types in the future like,

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.890
you know, when I was You
know, working primarily on

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.760
marketing and, and PR, it
would be, I would like,

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.070
make a schedule on like a
calendar.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.180
Have what, when we're gonna
launch things and like,

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.480
make sure to space them out,
but like have them,

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.240
you know, appear regular, at
regular intervals so

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.890
that people like didn't want
to forget about us.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:37.240
And we could kind of
maximize our coverage.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.820
And, you might really want
keep your, you know,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.530
contacts fresh.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.990
It like, really a
relationships business.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.140
So once you, someone writes
about you,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.410
you should keep going back
to them for, for

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:47.180
more, for writing about,

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.680
you know, to write about you
in the future.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.680
It's kind of like, you know,
when, when basically people,

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:54.780
you know, you're more likely
to do something for

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.480
someone you've, like,
already done something for.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.880
Yeah, you really, like,
it's, if you just, you know,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.360
I would try to establish
good,

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.170
good relationships with a
couple reporters over time

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:06.000
that you can go to to, you
know, break news.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.780
And it, it will come in

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:08.800
handy later if you ever
have, are in the position,

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.210
if you're fortunate enough
to be in the position where

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.720
people are writing negative
things about you, you know,

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.680
having relationships will
help you, you know, kind of

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.460
get your side of the story
out, The last thing is like,

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.580
you know, it's kind of
Golden Rule really, or

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.750
maybe more like a pay it
forward really applies here.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.180
Like, you should really help
your

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:27.610
fellow entrepreneurs get,

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.200
get coverage because they
will help you get coverage.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.130
The best way to get covered
is really through these like

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.120
warm introductions.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.730
And so you know, whenever
I'm meeting with reporters,

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.530
I always help like.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:41.320
Throwing out the names of
like other things that I

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320
think would be interesting
stories for them.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.520
And usually that comes back.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.450
They, the, the reporters
like it, because they,

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:48.490
it's like helping them find
interesting stories.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.210
And you're more likely to
get, you know, leads

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.070
back from entrepreneurs that
you help out.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:58.000
So, if you're interested in
learning more about press,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.449
here's two resources that I
really liked.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.380
Jason Kincaid, who was a
former TechCruch reporter,

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.620
just a really, really great
overview that covers a lot

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.270
of things I just talked
about, in more depth and

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.390
from the, you know, blogger
side.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.720
That was a really great
book.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.170
And then kind of an evil
resource is this book

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:17.500
Trust Me, I'm Lying.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.980
Which was written by the,

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.420
one of the a former marketer
at American Apparel.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.560
And he talks about like a
lot of ways that he

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.340
pretty like, evilly actually
manipulated the press, but

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.440
I think it's a pretty good
look

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.470
into like the psychology of
like how people, you know,

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.030
things spread on the
internet.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:35.580
You know, how stories spread
on the internet and

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.660
that, it's a.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.733
Might be valuable to take a
look at.

00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:44.668
Cool, that's, that's
basically it.

00:49:47.125 --> 00:49:49.380
One question?

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:50.770
Just 1?
>> 2, 2.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.088
>> 2 que, Okay, 2 questions.

00:49:52.088 --> 00:49:55.829
Or zero questions.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.200
>> When is the right time to
start worrying about

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.900
press altogether?

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:03.720
>> When is the right time to

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.420
start worrying about press
altogether?

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.710
I think it's a really good
way.

00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:08.362
Like if you just.

00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:09.898
The first time I launched,
you know,

00:50:09.898 --> 00:50:11.530
my first products in our
first startup.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:14.570
For a lot of them we got
like zero attention.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.270
And we didn't really know
how to even get

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.980
a hundred users.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.530
I think it's a really fine
way to

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:20.220
get a hundred users and a
lot of.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.800
Companies in YC where they
first launch their

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.340
product will encourage them
to get out and

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.290
just do one TechCrunch story
to, like, get a few

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:28.770
people to see it, and it's
good to get in the practice.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.260
I wouldn't, like, obsess
over getting, like,

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.490
coverage in multiple outlets
or

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:33.100
anything like that in the
very beginning.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.070
All right, anything else.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:37.930
There.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.400
>> It seems like

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.710
the biggest story
>> Yeah.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.550
>> Great, so like much of a,
how much of

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:47.945
a role did you guys actually
play in getting that

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:51.773
out
>> so,

00:50:51.773 --> 00:50:54.610
Twitch, you know, had this
thing called Twitch plays

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:57.025
Pokemon where developers set
up like a Pokemon,

00:50:57.025 --> 00:50:59.840
like Gameboy game that was
controlled by chat, so

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:03.240
millions of people would be
typing in A or B, and like.

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.580
The character would wander,
wander around aimlessly.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.480
And that was like a huge
news story and I think that

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.420
what we did was you know,
there's a couple parts.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.030
One, we set the stage by
having other news

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.570
stories that, so when
someone from the BBC would

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.330
Google like Twitch and be
like what is this

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.090
crazy thing that everyone on
Reddit is talking about?

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.637
They would, like, have some
context.

00:51:23.637 --> 00:51:24.680
The other thing is,

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.620
like, we didn't come up with
the idea for twit, right?

00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.280
That was, like fortuitous.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.020
But we helped, like, give it
legs by, you know,

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:34.430
making the company available
to talk to the reporters,

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:37.170
and, suggesting follow-up
stories about, like.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:38.255
You know, there were
stories,

00:51:38.255 --> 00:51:39.541
not just about Twitch plays
Pokemon,

00:51:39.541 --> 00:51:41.890
because a hundred thousand
people were watching this.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:45.590
Pokemon game, but because
you know, it finally like,

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.550
there were stories when they
beat the game.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.370
And there were stories when
they launched Twitch

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.300
plays Pokemon, you know,
Crystal, or

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.200
whatever the next Pokemon
version was.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:53.900
And like, and so

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.594
we kind of gave that story a
little more legs.

00:51:56.594 --> 00:51:58.260
But we didn't, you know,
originate it.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.896
It was the community really
who originated it.

00:52:00.896 --> 00:52:04.479
All right.

00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:07.970
I think that's it.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.010
Thank you very much.

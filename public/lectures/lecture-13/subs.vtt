00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.302
Thank you Sam.

00:00:01.302 --> 00:00:06.760
So when I looked through the
syllabus of this class and

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.180
thought about what I, I could
possibly add that would be

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.780
useful in addition to the
various skills.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.850
One of the things that I had
been thinking about had been,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.430
how do you think about
yourself as founder,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.800
how do you think about what
the skill set is?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.640
And what are the things that
you should be

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.810
thinking about in terms of am
I ready, how do I get ready,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.810
is it the right thing for me?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.270
These sorts of things.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.420
So let&#39;s start with the
perception of what

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.060
a great founder is.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.090
And classically, you know,
this tends to be Steve Jobs,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.190
Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Mark
Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.804
And it&#39;s an image of founder
as superwoman or superman

00:00:47.804 --> 00:00:52.450
right, who is, has this like
panopticon of skills, and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.310
I can use the word panopticon
because I&#39;m here at Stanford.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.560
But the, it&#39;s,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.310
it&#39;s things like, I know how
to do product market fit.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.840
I&#39;m great at product, I&#39;m
great at strategy,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.760
I&#39;m great at management, I can
fundraise.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.370
I can do all of these
different skills.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.940
And a part of what you&#39;re
looking for

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.570
in a great founder, in the
kind of theory of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.960
the founder as superperson, is
I&#39;m looking for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.920
someone who is awesome at all
these things.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.540
They are, they are, they are
well rounded,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.270
they are diverse, they can bat
on all skills.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.750
And you know, part of how I
found this kind of emphasized

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.330
in my own, the beginning of my
own entrepreneurial journey,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.480
is I remember reading an
article that said,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.930
you know, Bill Gates, who is
smarter than Einstein, right?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.440
And you&#39;re like, well look,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.600
Bill Gates is really smart and
he&#39;s very accomplished.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.760
But I&#39;m not quite sure smarter
than Einstein is actually

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.170
a phrase that even Bill would
want to be actually next to.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.210
And it&#39;s partially because I
think it&#39;s this image of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.450
founder as superperson, which
is that a great founder is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.710
someone who can do anything,
you know,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030
jump over tall tall buildings
in a single bound, you know,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.430
all of these sorts of things.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.470
And the reality, right, is the
founder is someone who

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.670
deals with a ton of different
headaches.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.800
And no one is universally
super powered.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.690
Generally speaking,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.350
you hope to have a couple of
super powers.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.510
Some things that are unique
edge to you.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.590
Some things that are unique to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.820
the problem that you are
trying to solve.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.990
Some things that may help you
give an edge because actually

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.250
competitive differentiation
and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.980
competitive edge is super
important.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.950
But but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
actually in fact a,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.930
a function of, of genius.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.460
And matter of fact frequently
it&#39;s very hard to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.700
tell the difference between
madness and

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.560
genius, because usually it&#39;s
the results that play out.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.880
And sometimes when you&#39;re
dealing with

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.250
uncertain environments, you
may even be genius and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.000
later be thought to be a mad
person.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.010
Or you may be a mad person and
you turn out to be lucky.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.660
And you&#39;re later thought to be
a genius.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.880
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s actually a kind
of challenging set of, like,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.820
how do you think about, you
know, these sets, you know,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.310
what is the whole set of
skills and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.390
what us mere mortals, you
know, come into this kind of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.290
battle what is the right way
to think about it?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.300
And so you know, when I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.200
thought about this question of
how is one a great founder.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.360
You know, part of what you get
to is.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.970
Oh, and actually, this is
probably the slide that for

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.720
people on this, this may have
been a suboptimal choice for

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.440
people on video, but it&#39;s
like,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.240
these are all skills that are
super important.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.840
Right?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.590
These are all things that you
say, well, okay, this is,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.300
this is really, really
important to do and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.300
you must in fact actually do
this well, and

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.570
it begins to look like a
superhuman task.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.600
And so what did, I decided to
take a,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.730
a subset of these and focused
on some of the,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.020
the interesting things to
think about,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.930
what is it that actually makes
a great founder?

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.280
Because it&#39;s actually not that
you score ten out of ten on

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.250
all these, you know, you&#39;re,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.930
you&#39;re the entrepreneurial
Olympiad.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.409
You, you are actually the best
at all of these things.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.260
So let&#39;s start with team.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.150
So one way to kind of, I
think, talk about

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.070
exploding the kind of the myth
of the super founder is that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.300
actually in fact usually it&#39;s
best so have two or

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.920
three people on a team rather
than a solar founder.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.010
Not to say solar founders
don&#39;t actually play out and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.330
they can successfully.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.440
But most often, two or three
people is actually in fact

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.638
a much better, when I look at
these things as an investor,

00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:22.220
and I say, you know, what is a
good composition of

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.700
a project and a, and founders
that are likely to succeed.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.230
It&#39;s usually there&#39;s two or
three of them, and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.410
the reasons are, because for
example we&#39;ve already talked

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.830
about the fact that there&#39;s
this very broad set of skills.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.030
There&#39;s this whole set of
question about how

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.050
you adapt your company in
order to be successful, and

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.670
if you actually have two or
three founders, you have,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.960
you have different skills, you
can compensate because,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.480
by the way, everyone has
weaknesses.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.510
You can compensate for each
other&#39;s weaknesses.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.830
You can in the diversity of
problems that you

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.530
encounter as a founder that
you can actually attack them.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.390
So one of the things that I, I
suggest when you,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.640
when you look at essentially a
founding team is to

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.170
have a real high preference
for having co-founders,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.560
having a high degree of trust
with those co-founders.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.370
Because one of the things, by
the way, part of the whole

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.910
entrepreneurial thing is
there&#39;s lots of ways to die.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.830
One of the ways to die is you
get a year down the road with

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.600
your co-founders and

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.960
then you&#39;re going through a
messy divorce.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.870
And that&#39;s a,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.760
that&#39;s a, that is not always
but frequently fatal.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.740
And so and then also the
diversity of the kind of

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.120
tasks that you&#39;re trying to
do.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.030
And actually.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, yes, I was about to
say,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.420
that would be suboptimal from
the viewpoint of being able to

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.520
look at the slides.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.330
The next thing is location.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.940
And so frequently I&#39;ve heard,
told to me, it&#39;s like oh,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.680
Silicon Valley aggregates all
of this super talent,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.370
which it does.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.330
In terms of, like, what, what
actually in fact, it&#39;s, it&#39;s,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.550
the reason why Silicon Valley
startups are so successful is

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.050
because all of these great
people immigration,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.830
which is hugely important for,
for talent and

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.240
founders and everything else,
you know, emigrate here.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.270
And that&#39;s part of the reason.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.000
Now, it&#39;s actually, if you
think about it,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.010
from basic math, ne, even if
you take something that,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.010
that Silicon Valley is super
strong at, which is

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.850
essentially software skills in
the last two decades.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.420
Not all of the great software
people move here.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.730
No, not all of &#39;em can move
here.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.610
There are many of

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.270
them in various other parts of
the world.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.780
And, and so why do I put
choice of location as one of

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.000
the things it comes down to,
thinking whether or

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.480
not you&#39;re a great founder.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.510
Well, the reason is, is
because what fo,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.410
great founders do is seek the
networks that will be

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.830
essential to their problem and
their task.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.120
And they realize that it isn&#39;t
just about, like,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.950
kind of like, I am super
person.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.060
I can do this anywhere.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.989
I can do this, you know, in,

00:06:52.989 --> 00:06:55.950
you know, the Antarctic, et
cetera.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.320
It&#39;s, in order to be
successful I have to go to

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.050
where the strongest networks
are for the particular kind of

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.090
problem or the particular kind
of thing that I&#39;m doing.

00:07:04.108 --> 00:07:05.590
And Silicon Valley, by the
way,

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.720
is super good at some kind of
tasks.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.550
Some places that you
essentially try to

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.830
solve certain kinds of
problems.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.010
But it&#39;s not good at all of
them.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.070
Let me take, you know, kind of
two examples.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.160
So one is Groupon.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.460
I don&#39;t think Groupon could&#39;ve
ever been founded here.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.060
Even though it&#39;s a software
product,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.950
it actually even generates a
network.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.750
Which, you know, obviously a
lot of the great networks

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.990
are here and and uses a a kind
of Internet technology

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.670
as a mobile product and
everything else, all of

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.250
which we have a lot of skills
here in Silicon Valley and

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.120
the networks are really good
for this.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.950
One of the things that&#39;s
central for GroupOn for

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.150
it&#39;s early days was having
massive sales forces, and

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.670
massive sales forces strengths
and

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.190
weaknesses of networks tend to
go together.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:55.320
Silicon Valley tends to be
pretty adverse to plans that

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.380
involve, like oh,

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.120
we&#39;re going to rent a 25 story
building and in 20 of

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.570
those stories we&#39;re going to
have floors of sales people,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.630
and that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to
get out thing going.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.080
That kind of plan here tends
to not get a lot of interest,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.240
tends to get a lot of
criticism,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.540
tends to not have talent po-,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.710
aggregate to it, tends to have
financiers talk up of

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.440
things like capital efficiency
and network effects and

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.850
other kinds of things that
are, that are key here.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.230
And so it&#39;s actually not a
surprise that actually,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.260
in fact, Groupon require, was
required to be actually in

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.200
Chicago, which is really good
at this.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.820
As a way of actually kind of
getting going, and showing

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.820
that even software startups
can be in other places.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.640
But even if you begin to think
about you say,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.718
okay, well what kinds of, of,
of you know, other kinds of

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:42.190
startups would someone be an
idiot to move here to do.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.270
Think of someone were doing a
fashion start up.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.529
Not fashion a la Poshmark
which is you know,

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:49.461
a mobile marketplace et cetera
which are a bunch of things

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:50.810
that are good here.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.600
But like I&#39;m develop,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.270
designing a new fashion
company and

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.570
I&#39;m going to come to silicon
valley to do it.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.445
That&#39;s actually not such a
great idea.

00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:01.100
Right not saying the fashion
company might be a great idea

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.600
but you want the networks that
support what you&#39;re doing.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.790
And so part of the reason why
where I,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.780
where I locate my startup is a
test for thinking

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.150
about am I a great founder is
because part of what happens

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.360
when you&#39;re actually founding
a company is you&#39;re going,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.150
I will go to where it&#39;s
successful to this to do.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.410
To, to, to be because the
metaphor that I frequently use

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.280
for entrepreneurship is
jumping off a cliff and

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.620
assembling an airplane on the
way down,

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.410
and the reason is because it&#39;s
hard, it has

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.810
a quasi-mortal exit by which
you&#39;re default dead, and so

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.310
you&#39;re taking every possible
chance to actually win.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.610
And so great founders go,
look,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.560
I&#39;ll move to what the network
is and that network is,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.280
you know, this graphic is
frequently Silicon Valley.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.010
But for, for text startups,
for mobile, for

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.310
networks, for marketplaces,
you know,

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.790
this is a really good place to
do it.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.000
For a bunch of other things
you

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.350
should think about whether or
not it&#39;s a different location.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.580
Now here&#39;s something that, you
know,

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.320
it&#39;s very in vogue, all right,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.969
very conventional, to say
you&#39;re contrarian these days.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.080
And so, let&#39;s talk a little
bit about what contrarianness

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.230
actually in fact is.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.730
so, it&#39;s actually pretty easy
to be contrarian.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.970
It&#39;s hard to be contrarian and
right.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.390
And in particular, when you&#39;re
thinking about,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.419
is my idea contrarian or
contrarian enough.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:24.746
It&#39;s how does a smart person
actually disagree with

00:10:24.746 --> 00:10:25.639
me right?

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:29.435
Is, because if you can&#39;t think
of a smart person-

00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:32.297
Who isn&#39;t like ignorant or
just crazy or isn&#39;t, but

00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.904
is a smart person who is
somewhat expert in that so

00:10:34.904 --> 00:10:37.701
thinks that your idea has some
serious challenges,

00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:40.590
then it actually isn&#39;t
contrarian.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.500
Right?
So contrarian, and

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.750
contrarian is also is always,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.400
actually this is one of the
things that Sam and

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.520
I talked about at startup
school is contrarian is

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.380
actually relative to an
audience, right?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.240
So.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.178
When you want to be, when
you&#39;re,

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:54.220
when you&#39;re thinking about
contrarian in terms of,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.300
like a really good contrarian
idea is like okay,

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.660
what would other, say it&#39;s
consumer Internet,

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.570
good consumer Internet people
think is actually in

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.995
fact not yet a good idea.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:07.930
And part of what you think
about contrarian is to say,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.590
okay, what&#39;s the way that what
do

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.950
I know that other people don&#39;t
know?

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.120
Because it isn&#39;t just that I&#39;m
brilliant and

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.130
other people aren&#39;t and

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.040
that&#39;s reason why contrarian
thing is right.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.610
That&#39;s a very bad test.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.570
Right, it happened to be true.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.190
Of course, lightening could
also strike you in the field.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.200
You know, so, think a lot
about, like,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.160
what is that I know that other
people don&#39;t know?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.520
So, for example, in the very
early days of LinkedIn,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.860
part of what I advised all
founders to do was go talk to

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.290
every smart person who will
talk to you and

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.450
give you feedback.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.740
So, at LinkedIn I walked
around and

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.780
said here&#39;s my idea, what do
you think?

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.520
Two thirds or more of my
network, including some of

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.080
the very, very smart people,
all thought I was nuts.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.610
And they reason why they
thought I was nuts was because

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.500
they said well look, it&#39;s a
network product, it&#39;s only

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.230
valuable with a bunch of
people in it, first person no

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.490
value, invite second person,
second person first person,

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.740
no value for either of them,
they already know each other.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.470
When do you,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.890
when do you actually begin to
deliver on your use case.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.520
Which is like 500k to a
million people.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.110
Right.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.920
And so, you&#39;re never going to
get to size,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.150
you&#39;re never going to grow.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.710
Now what I knew that the
critique,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.790
the critics didn&#39;t know.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.180
Was that I could think of a
set of different ways by which

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.900
people could say, look it&#39;s
pretty easy to say, look I

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.840
believe in the vision of this,
or I think it&#39;s interesting,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.290
or I think a product like this
should exist, or

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.440
I&#39;m willing to play around
with it and I can use,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.160
leverage, those sets of
interests to grow the network,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.210
to get to enough size that you
could begin to deliver on

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.110
the value propositions in
which LinkedIn had.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.020
And that was the specific
thing that I knew

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.700
that the critics weren&#39;t
thinking about.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.320
And so when you think about
being contrarian, you have to

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.180
think about how is it that
smart people disagree with me?

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.200
They disagree with me from a
position of

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.250
intelligence right.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.940
And there&#39;s something that I
know that they don&#39;t

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.680
know that actually in fact
will play out to be true.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.110
Now, in this case, in general
as a, as a founder it&#39;s good

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.580
to be contrarian in the real
sense and right.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.260
Now the other last part on the
contrariness is to think about

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.090
there&#39;s a lot of different
ways to be contrarian.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.580
So for example, a frequent one
will be is like, oh yeah,

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.720
that&#39;s a good small idea but
actually not so

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.030
small it&#39;s large.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.990
Or you know, actually in fact
you can assemble the talent or

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.080
while most consumer internet
start ups tend to be like for

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.829
example, this is another
LinkedIn example tend to be

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.970
only successful through rocket
ships.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.240
Actually a gradual compounding
curve can actually be very,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.610
very valuable.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.050
LinkedIn never had its rocket
ship moment.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.950
It was, it was kind of
compound year by year.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.290
But that in the consumer
internet,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.900
tends to be a atypical to the
pattern.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.350
So here you begin to get to a
bunch of sorts of

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:42.580
problems that, essentially
founders run into,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.910
which is like, well should I
be doing the work or

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.590
should be recruiting people
and delegating the work.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.990
And classically the answer to
this is,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.900
actually in fact you need to
do both.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.450
Right, and, in fact, not only
do you need to do both,

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.520
you need to do sometimes one
at 100% and

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.210
sometimes the other one at
100%.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.290
And sometimes, even though
this is not so

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.400
good at math, both at 100%.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.820
And so what you&#39;ll see is,
this is actually classic

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.970
when you begin thinking about
what is a great founder?

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.160
Is you navigate what is
apparent paradoxes?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.290
So another one that I
frequently talk about is,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.570
you got to be both flexible
and persistent.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.920
And the reason for this is,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.720
entrepreneurs are frequently
given the advice to, you know,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.790
have a vision.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.650
Stay firm against adversity.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.940
You know, realize that you,
you have this vision that

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.440
is contrarian to what other
people think, and

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.640
just ho, stay on track,

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.910
get through the difficult
times, and get there.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.270
The other piece of advice
given with equal vigor is,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.790
listen to data, listen to
customers.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.951
pivot.
Be flexible!

00:14:42.951 --> 00:14:45.912
Part of the thing this comes
out to meaning in terms of

00:14:45.912 --> 00:14:47.998
being a great founder is to
say well,

00:14:47.998 --> 00:14:51.270
when should I be persistent,
when should I be flexible?

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.100
And the, the vehicle that I
most often use for

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.870
this is you should have on a
project you&#39;re doing,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.470
like a company, an investment
thesis that essentially says

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.470
why you think possibly
contrarian.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.320
Why you think this is a
potentially good idea.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.210
It should include what you
know that you

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.260
think other people don&#39;t know
and then, as you&#39;re

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.980
going into the battlefield,
you go is, you know, am I

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.300
in fact increasing confidence
in my investment pieces or

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.800
decreasing confidence in my
investment pieces?

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.050
Because I&#39;ve got increasing
confidence, then oh,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.840
stay on track, you know, be
persistent.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.850
And by the way, sometimes even
with adversity,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.510
you&#39;re confidence can, can
increase.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.580
If it&#39;s decreasing, that
doesn&#39;t mean jump out.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.120
PayPal, LinkedIn, Airbnb,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.430
a whole bunch of startups I&#39;ve
been I&#39;ve been a part of have

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.840
had months where you were
like, oh my God this,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.340
why would did we ever think
this was a good idea it

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.270
was kind of a valley of the
shadows moment.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.640
So like example, in PayPal it
was, you know,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.980
August 2000 we were burning
$12 million in one month,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.880
the expense curve was
exponentiating,

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.100
we had no revenue, decrease in
confidence,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.560
however we say okay what we do
in order to fix that, and

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.290
that gives you your immediate
action plan.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.930
Another one is, should you
have belief or

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.090
should you have fear?

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.950
Right, should you have, you
know,

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.590
should you essentially go well
no I have this vision of

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.690
the way the world should be
and

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.030
I should ignore everything
else and

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.710
I should just go at that.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.200
Well again, part of what being
a great founder is,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.020
is being both able to hold the
belief, to think about what it

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.270
is you want to be doing and
want to, want to be going.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.150
But also be smart enough that
you&#39;re essentially listening

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.200
to criticism, negative
feedback, competitive entries,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.810
where you&#39;re kind of going
okay,

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.570
is this changing my investment
thesis?

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.360
Is this changing what I&#39;m
planning on doing?

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.620
It doesn&#39;t mean you lose
confidence.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.063
You have the confidence, but

00:16:40.063 --> 00:16:41.915
you also essentially have the
peril.

00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:46.141
Again, in this kind of thing
of how do you put these two

00:16:46.141 --> 00:16:48.776
things together, should I
focus internally, build

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:51.835
the product, ignore the world,
ignore competitors etc.,

00:16:51.835 --> 00:16:53.530
.
or should I focus externally?

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.410
Should I be recruiting?

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.310
Should I be meeting people?

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.170
Should I be gathering network
intelligence?

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.840
Again, the answer is both.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.990
And the reason why I&#39;m
focusing on these kind of

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.220
it&#39;s, it&#39;s both rather than
either or, is because part of

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.820
what makes a great founder is
the ability to,

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.780
to, to be flexible across
these lines.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.630
To sometimes be 90% one way,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.080
sometimes be 80% the other
way.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.880
Be executing the judgement on

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.680
what is the current problem
look like.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.500
How is it that when I&#39;m trying
to solve this,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.690
that I should say, this is
what we should be doing and

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.500
how should I be dividing the
work?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.280
And part of, when you think
about these things, and

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.010
you just say like this is

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.270
another one that&#39;s kind of
classic is people say, well,.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:34.425
I&#39;m completely motivated by
data.

00:17:34.425 --> 00:17:36.500
It&#39;s what customers say at the
user groups.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.440
You know?
I&#39;ve,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.330
a lot of entrepreneurial
methodologies lean,

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.320
other kinds of things are
talked about is like,

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.440
gather the data, be guided on
the data.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.010
Well actually in fact, data
only exists within

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.770
a framework of the vision that
you&#39;re building to

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.260
a hypothesis of where you&#39;re
moving to.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.050
And the data can even be
negative and

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.480
you can think, well actually
in fact,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.530
this negative data means that
I need to change, or

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.710
alter the way that I&#39;m
thinking about something.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.190
But I actually keep on a
specific vision about

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.210
what I&#39;m doing.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:03.910
And, and by the way,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.390
sometimes even when you have
that specific vision,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.110
you don&#39;t necessarily
actually, you never end up at

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.680
that big vision that you were
thinking about.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.178
So for example, you know, at
PayPal we distributed these

00:18:14.178 --> 00:18:18.720
t-shirts that said the new
global world currency, right?

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.250
Well actually in fact one of
the, the and I,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.570
and I know Peter&#39;s been here.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.880
One of the jokes I told Peter
is like well actually we do

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.150
have this new world global
currency.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.520
What we&#39;re trading in is
dollars.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.100
You may have heard of it, it&#39;s
existed for a while.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.680
Right?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.030
We&#39;re essentially a master
merchant for that.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.540
now, course this message is
what may be happening with

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.760
BitCoin although, you know, is
a whole other topic there.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.650
However, the key thing is that
that vision of saying, we&#39;re

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.780
creating a kind of a universal
network that allows anyone to,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.030
to pay, anyone to become a
merchant.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.480
To bring the electronics into
the speed of commerce at

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.890
any business that, that is
being transacted.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.690
That vision kept at true north
by, we say well,

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.280
first we think we&#39;re going to
have a banking model.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.250
Then we think we&#39;re going to
have, you know, a, a,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.820
a debt model.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.970
Oh no, we&#39;re actually going to
have a master merchant model.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.260
And how does that actually
play out?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.950
So you&#39;re always combining the
vision and the data.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.830
And the data&#39;s within the
framework of, of a vision.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.820
And sometimes, of course, what
you learn changes your vision.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.410
Now, this is one of the ones I
actually think we,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.200
we, we saved this special
picture for

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.960
one of the ones that I
actually think is quite key.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.340
Is that normally
entrepreneurs, founders,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:33.730
are thought about as having
like the risk takers, right?

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.020
They&#39;re, they&#39;re, they, they,
whereas everyone else cowers

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.780
in fear from this notion of
risk they boldly go out.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.020
Now, that&#39;s true.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.560
You have to be a risk taker.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.520
You have to be thinking about
how do I

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.250
make a really coherent bet on
risk because in fact,

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.310
the only really big
opportunities, the only

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.790
contrarian opportunities that
smart people disagree with you

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.910
on happen to be ones that have
risk associated with them.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.410
On the other hand, part of the
skill set that when

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.680
you&#39;re beginning to apply how
you think about risks as

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.000
an entrepreneur is you&#39;re
beginning to

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.750
think about like how do I take
intelligent risks.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.150
How do I take a focused risk
that if I&#39;m right about that

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.710
one thing then a bunch of
other things break my way.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.453
And once I start doing that, I
try to figure out how to

00:20:18.453 --> 00:20:21.600
make my, my, on shot
possibility as high as

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.681
possible eg how do I minimize
other risks?

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:27.622
How do I essentially take this
risk in an intelligent way

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:29.670
that doesn&#39;t just go oh yeah
risk.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.350
Risk to the wind.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.270
Who cares?

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.830
But let&#39;s go.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.560
And so this kind of combines
that, you know, this,

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.350
this image which I think is
the best of the,

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.320
of the, of, of the images we
found for

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.560
this yet, is kind of the sense
of how to think about.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.489
Now, back to what I was saying
in terms of having

00:20:45.489 --> 00:20:48.821
an investment thesis, part of
having an investment thesis

00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.902
is, you chart it out, it&#39;s
kind of a list of bullets.

00:20:51.902 --> 00:20:53.089
You say, like for example,

00:20:53.089 --> 00:20:55.564
in early LinkedIn it was like
look everyone is actually

00:20:55.564 --> 00:20:58.127
going to be benefited by
public professional network.

00:20:58.127 --> 00:21:00.696
Everyone will realize
including companies that it&#39;s

00:21:00.696 --> 00:21:03.758
better to have it play out
this way the initial set of

00:21:03.758 --> 00:21:06.436
adoption will come from
essentially people who were

00:21:06.436 --> 00:21:09.279
like visualize the role, thus
were willing to play with it,

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:11.621
and then eventually the mass
market will come on as

00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:13.237
they begin to have a network
that is

00:21:13.237 --> 00:21:16.510
already delivering a value
proposition to them.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.520
That&#39;s what kind of

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.420
an investment thesis can look
like and then,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.260
you know, you&#39;ve got economics
like initial recruiting and

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.410
then, and then broadening and
other things.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.000
You have that investment
thesis and

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.840
you say, is my investment
thesis increasing or

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.210
decreasing in confidence?

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.930
Do I think that the data I get
from the market,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.950
when I talk to smart people,
how does that,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.470
how does that change my
confidence in it?

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.850
And this is actually how you
essentially minimize risk.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:47.910
So, for example, very early,
very early days in PayPal the,

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.900
part of what happened is, they
said,

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.180
okay well, we&#39;re going to do
cash on mobile phones.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.200
We&#39;ll do cash on Palm Pilots
because it&#39;s really easy.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.030
We actually realized that cash
on Palm Pilots wouldn&#39;t work

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.010
even before we launched the
product.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.980
Because basically what
happened is,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.520
I went in and said to Max and
Peter.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.050
I said look here&#39;s our
challenge,

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.370
our challenge is, we&#39;re
probably doesn&#39;t remember what

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.950
Palm Pilot&#39;s are.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.470
They were like, like early
PDAs And so

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.160
yeah we lived in what was Palm
Pilot central.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.710
And the whole use case case
was splitting dinner tab.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.930
And, how many people,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.771
everyone at the table would
have a PalmPilot Zero to

00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:27.780
one in every single
restaurant.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.220
So, you could even just by
thinking it through,

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.430
you realize that the direction
you&#39;re on is

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.790
going to hit a minefield and
you need to pivot, and

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.510
that&#39;s when Max Legend came up
with the idea of saying,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.110
actually in fact we could
synch by emails,

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.080
we could have email payments
as backbone of this, and

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.240
we were like oh, that&#39;s a good
idea.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.970
And of course,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.220
that&#39;s what the whole thing
kind of pivoted into.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.930
And that&#39;s part of thinking
through minimizing the risks,

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.240
as you&#39;re actually executing.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.140
Here&#39;s another one that&#39;s kind
of classic.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.060
Which is, well, should I have
this long term vision?

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.520
Or should I be solving local,
near term problems?

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.860
And again, the answer is both.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.760
It&#39;s these paradoxes and

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.790
the question is, is you jump
between them.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.950
You should always have a long
term vision in mind because if

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.970
you actually completely lose
your, your directions

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.890
eventually you&#39;ll find
yourself in some field there&#39;s

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.260
not a good path out of, but if
you&#39;re not focused on solving

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.430
the problem that&#39;s immediately
in front of you, you&#39;re hosed.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.170
Right.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:22.150
And so part of the the
question about how you

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.358
put these things together is
you say, okay,

00:23:24.358 --> 00:23:27.960
short term what&#39;s the thing I
need to be doing today?

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.030
Have I made progress today?

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.430
have I made progress this
week?

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.720
But is it largely on path?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.040
So, I&#39;ll give you an example
of how this plays out in

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.230
terms of financing or in terms
of strategy.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.340
So people frequently think
product strategy is

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.115
fundamental to how, start-ups.

00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:44.660
Like I have a have a product
idea, that&#39;s a thing,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.000
I&#39;m a founder.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.780
Actually in fact, the next
level down on

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.490
strategy is usually a product
distribution.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.450
Whether it&#39;s consumer Internet
or or enterprise or

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.290
anything else.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.890
Because actually in fact no
matter how good your

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.060
product is, if it doesn&#39;t get
to customers you&#39;re hosed.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.022
So usually you have to have
product distribution as

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:03.820
more fundamental than the
actually what the product is.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.150
And the one below it is
financing.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.180
And the reason why it&#39;s
financing is if you run out of

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.940
money and the whole effort
goes away,

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.140
even if you have a really good
idea it doesn&#39;t work.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.150
So frequently when you&#39;re
executing on a good

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:16.430
strategy you&#39;re actually in
fact, when I&#39;m raising money,

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.700
this fundraising, I&#39;m thinking
about the next fundraising.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.240
I&#39;m thinking about how I&#39;m set
up for it, I&#39;m establishing

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.330
relationships that would be
key to that and I&#39;m,

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.880
I&#39;m not executing like oh, the
only thing that matters is I

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.130
get to the next, is, is get to
the next fundraising because

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.970
you have this business that
you&#39;re building.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.170
But I am thinking that as a
core strategy in

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.480
terms of how I&#39;m executing and

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.920
frequently you&#39;re thinking
about okay, how does my

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.880
product distribution work such
that the financing works well?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.630
And that&#39;s kind of how

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.090
you architect these things
together.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.440
So how do you know if you
might be a great founder?

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.430
Well, it&#39;s, you should have
some superpowers.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.250
It&#39;s generally speaking in

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.110
software useful to be a good
product person.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.870
It&#39;s useful to have good
skills about kind of

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.610
leadership of bringing
networks in,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.820
of persuading people.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.780
And it&#39;s useful to be able to,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.580
and this is kind of the most
fundamental,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.290
is recognize whether or not
you&#39;re on track or not.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.570
To have both that kind of
belief, but also

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:17.200
paranoia about, am I tracking
against my investment thesis?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.390
And when you do that the right
way, and you&#39;re learning, and

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.720
you&#39;re assembling people, and

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.630
you&#39;re assembling networks
around you,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.540
that&#39;s generally speaking,

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.970
how you end up being a great
founder.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.160
Now, classically and

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.410
I deliberately put up five
white men, male pictures.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.250
It&#39;s classically,

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.820
you have a kind of a these are
the iconic founders.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.790
But in fact, founders can be
very diverse,

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.710
they can be extraordinarily
talented at

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.110
different areas because
there&#39;s different kinds of

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:51.000
entrepreneurial companies,
there&#39;s different kinds of

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
problems they&#39;re trying to
solve.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.560
And I don&#39;t just mean
diversity in terms of classic,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.450
you know, kind of gender,
race, et cetera.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.350
I, diversity in age, diversity
in experience.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.330
You know, Jack Baugh was a, a,
was a,

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.570
a teacher before he got into
this.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.150
That&#39;s the kind of thing that
you can,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:08.960
that you should think about.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.780
And so the, the question is,

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.860
is how you cross uneven
ground.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.290
How you assemble networks
around you.

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.670
How you get people to assemble
this,

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:21.800
it&#39;s a constantly changing
problem to face when you

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.458
are trying to found a company.

00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:28.660
And so, I think that the thing
that I was trying

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.830
to get people to think about
with this is to say,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.760
there&#39;s not one skill set.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.940
There&#39;s an ability to learn
and adapt,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.260
an ability to constantly have
a vision that&#39;s driving you,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.160
but to be taking input from
all sources and

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.920
then to be cre, creating
networks around you,

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.870
and that&#39;s essentially what
makes a great founder.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:48.900
And your ability to

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.350
do that while crossing uneven
ground in a fog.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.070
Which is kind of the, the,
the, the way that

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.700
entrepreneurs, because you
don&#39;t really know like,

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.820
did you always know this was
going to work?

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:58.940
No.
Unless you are crazy.

00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:01.520
Right.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.470
Sometimes crazy works.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.620
So with that I will now go to
a few questions.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.840
But it was kind of this mind
set of founders.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.559
Which is kind of key.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.600
And if there&#39;s no ques, oh,
here.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.090
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m curious about how
Nathan, how you

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:21.570
you targeted the earlier, or
you selected the guys for

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:25.020
getting the right doctors who
knew would strengthen your

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.280
investment thesis to really
help it take off because it

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.200
seems like every start up is
faced with that.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.190
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; That same challenge.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.900
&gt;&gt; So one of the really
fundamental things is to,

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.290
is to think about product
distribution as key.

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.990
And for LinkedIn, we had a
couple things going for us.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.790
So one, the web was boring in
2003.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.660
That basically what happened
is everyone had

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.010
thought the consumer net was
over.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.650
And so people were doing clean
tag and

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.060
enterprise software and
everything else.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.650
It&#39;s a much harder problem
now.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:53.900
because everyone thinks the
Internet and

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.620
mobile is interesting.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.090
And so breaking through the
noise is really key.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.920
So the strategy we use
wouldn&#39;t work.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.940
We just set up,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.575
sent out some invitations to a
group of people and then

00:28:02.575 --> 00:28:05.560
tuned the mechanism to have,
and did PR to get people.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.640
Like one of the decisions we
made early that was right was

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.090
to say should we only allow it
as invite only?

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.290
Or should we allow cold sign
ups?

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.760
The reason we should allow
cold sign ups is

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.240
because the people who are
super enthusiastic about this

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.530
weren&#39;t necessarily the people
you know,

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.460
so they would sign up and
spread it.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.480
That sort of thing were all
the kind of decisions we made.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.360
Now that challenge is much
harder because the challenge

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.765
when you think about product
distribution is,

00:28:25.765 --> 00:28:28.170
it&#39;s how are you competing for
potential customers&#39; or

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.510
potential members time and
what do they think,

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.480
what do they have to believe
in.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.910
Back in 2003 it was like
well,a professional network.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.010
That&#39;s potentially a good
idea, what the hell.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:36.670
I&#39;ll play with that.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.880
There&#39;s not a lot of other
things for me to look at.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.630
Today, there&#39;s tons of things
and so your strategy today,

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.960
when you&#39;re looking at product
distribution,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.620
has to be, what is my really
decisive edge?

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:51.890
What is the hack that I know
that other people don&#39;t know?

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.859
&gt;&gt; Someone come to you,

00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:01.393
how do you tell
&gt;&gt; So

00:29:01.393 --> 00:29:04.683
how do I know someone&#39;s a good
founder or not?

00:29:04.683 --> 00:29:08.550
well, it&#39;s not I&#39;m a huge
believer in references.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.855
Usually I only ever, actually
no.

00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:16.270
100% of the time in this case,
I only meet with someone when

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.460
they come to me through a
reference.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.920
So one of the things, by the
way is,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.070
the thing is I, after this I
have to run off because I

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.700
have a meeting I need to get
to.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.215
If you want to actually get
time and

00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:25.790
attention Lee, find a
reference.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.640
It&#39;s not a pitch to using
LinkedIn, it&#39;s a question of,

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.290
this is how you sort out time.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.210
You can find out, like Sam
knows me.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.520
Lift up, throw Sam under the
bus.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.090
Right?

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.590
Yes.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.920
And so a reference to me is in
fact the way that I do this.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.630
And so for example, when I met
with the AirBnB guys.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.650
Part of the reason why I

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:48.070
could interrupt them two
minutes into their pitch, and

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.940
say, I&#39;m going to make you an
offer to invest.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.114
I want to hear the rest of the
pitch,

00:29:52.114 --> 00:29:53.460
because I think what you&#39;re
doing here is,

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.850
is, is magical and awesome.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.055
Was because I&#39;d already had
references on them.

00:29:58.055 --> 00:29:58.870
Like that was only two
minutes,

00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.800
not even thirty minutes.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.780
Because I already knew about
them before coming in.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.910
And by the way, by and large
that&#39;s some version of

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.960
that is true of most of the
great industries.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.550
And it&#39;s that, it&#39;s that
network that&#39;s really key.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.140
I think there was a question
over here too.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.832
Here.
&gt;&gt; So would you consider it

00:30:12.832 --> 00:30:15.819
intensity of insight to be a
strong signal for

00:30:15.819 --> 00:30:17.003
great founders.

00:30:17.003 --> 00:30:18.695
Density of insight is a strong
signal for

00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:20.750
great founders, can you say
another sentence?

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.879
&gt;&gt; Being able to distill a
thesis out of or

00:30:24.879 --> 00:30:26.853
operate off a thesis.

00:30:26.853 --> 00:30:29.082
A deal of doubt to a concise
sentence.

00:30:29.082 --> 00:30:32.129
&gt;&gt; Well, I would definitely
say that the ability to

00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:34.806
say coherently what you&#39;re
targeting and

00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:36.526
to articulate something.

00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:39.113
That isn&#39;t trying to boil the
ocean or a Swiss army knife

00:30:39.113 --> 00:30:41.920
approach but is like one focus
like look if we&#39;re right about

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.563
this than it works, that is
actually pretty important to

00:30:44.563 --> 00:30:46.710
be, to being able to judge a
founder because if

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.573
you don&#39;t have that level of,
of clarity you&#39;re not going to

00:30:49.573 --> 00:30:51.646
be able to assemble the
network behind you.

00:30:51.646 --> 00:30:53.038
You&#39;re not going to be able to
get investors,

00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:54.153
you&#39;re not going to get
employees.

00:30:54.153 --> 00:30:55.690
You have to be able to
articulate a very

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.382
clear mission about what
you&#39;re doing.

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:01.763
And insight is helpful
although,

00:31:01.763 --> 00:31:05.026
a little bit of this depends
on the stage.

00:31:05.026 --> 00:31:07.690
It, it is always, if I find, I
find myself attracted to

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:10.132
founders who&#39;ve analyzed the
problem a good way,

00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:12.857
but, but frequently I&#39;ve seen
great founders who do not

00:31:12.857 --> 00:31:14.107
present good analysis but

00:31:14.107 --> 00:31:16.295
have an instinct about what
they&#39;re doing.

00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:17.413
And so you more chart what
kind of,

00:31:17.413 --> 00:31:18.423
what&#39;s going on around them.

00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:26.871
&gt;&gt; When Lincoln had like five
years of like I guess

00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:31.078
Wrap up times, like what, what
can be going to keep like

00:31:31.078 --> 00:31:34.200
doubling down the original
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.930
So, how do I keep persistence
when,

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:39.260
because, actually, LinkedIn
went through, you know,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.610
let&#39;s see, for those who
remember.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:47.060
We were treated as the little
alternative to Friendster,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.558
then to MySpace, then to
Facebook.

00:31:49.558 --> 00:31:51.150
Righ.
So, we had a lot of different,

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:53.900
like we&#39;re the little tiny one
next to these

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.170
respective giants each at the
time.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.570
Ultimately, for me, when I was
thinking about LinkedIn.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:00.220
This gets back to

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.240
the investment thesis as a
mechanism.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.960
I continue to believe the
action fact,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.180
the right economic system
design for

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.580
every individual&#39;s life and
for

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.970
organization&#39;s life is to have
public professional profiles.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.000
That world is the way the
world should be.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.960
Everyone is much better off
with it.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.870
And we are getting closer to
that than everyone else.

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.500
It may be that it hasn&#39;t taken
off as fast as I&#39;d like,

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.870
it may be that the general
world is going,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.700
oh this social stuff is really
interesting.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.540
We don&#39;t.
Like,

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.500
we could only get in the news
in the Fall and

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.220
the Summer of 2003 by saying
we were Friendster but for

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.770
business, which is completely,
like,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.700
nonsensical once you begin to
look at the thing.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.220
But it was like okay

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.980
we&#39;ll cover you cause it&#39;s
friends but for business.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.630
And that was important to
begin to get people to

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.950
pay attention to us.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:47.270
And so the confidence was that
world I still have

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.805
confidence believe that it
should exist and

00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:51.960
no-one is getting closer to it
than we.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.230
It&#39;s taking us maybe longer
than I&#39;d hoped to

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.530
get there but that&#39;s okay.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.090
So.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:32:58.890
Sam?

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.690
&gt;&gt; When you get it wrong, when
you meet a fund that you

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.580
think is going to be really
good and.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.520
You know, seems to be a move
between these opposing forces.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.420
&gt;&gt; Yup.
&gt;&gt; And on paper it

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.890
seems like they&#39;re going to go
the distance.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.230
What is it that makes you get
wrong about someone that

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.370
looks good at first
observation?

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.690
&gt;&gt; Well to some degree you can
only fully cross this kind of

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.020
minefield by actually going
and doing it, right?

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.530
So you can be wrong about your
hypothesis.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.970
The kinds of things that
frequently get you wrong,

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:28.230
get wrong or when you think
that a person because they.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.520
Like for example, one of the
tests that I frequently use in

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.840
interaction is I push on the
idea some, and

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.200
what I&#39;m looking for is both
flexibility and persistence.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:36.860
I&#39;m looking for, no,

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.440
I have conviction in what I&#39;m
thinking and I&#39;m arguing it,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.220
but I&#39;m listening to what
you&#39;re saying and

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.050
I&#39;m adapting to the concerns
and

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.720
whatnot of how you think about
that.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.840
Sometimes you&#39;ll find someone
who says, look, I&#39;ve learned

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.150
to mimic that behavior, so
I&#39;ve learned to say for

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.760
example I&#39;ve learned to look,
look like I&#39;m reasoning with

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.860
you and I look like I&#39;m, I&#39;m
thinking about the challenge

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.080
you&#39;re brining up but actually
in fact I&#39;m ignoring you.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.580
Right?

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.550
And ignoring me that might be
fine.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.690
Right?
Ignoring the world in

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.050
general is usually a disaster.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.700
And so those are the kind of
things that in the measurement

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.228
you can see essentially
getting wrong.

00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:12.513
But usually, the kind of thing
like,

00:34:12.513 --> 00:34:16.516
most often, the kind of
reference questions I

00:34:16.516 --> 00:34:21.400
asked about founders is like
adaptability.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.540
Like one of the phrases that I
frequently look for

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.210
is infinite learning curve.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.950
Because each entrepreneurial
pattern is, to some degree,

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:30.560
unique and new, and can you
learn the new one?

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.418
Huh, right, is a way of doing
it.

00:34:31.418 --> 00:34:36.310
And so like, does the learning
break down, or

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:37.940
is there some major skill-set?

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.970
Is there an ego issue that
gets in the way?

00:34:39.970 --> 00:34:41.540
Like, well, I must be the.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.830
Like, everyone, everyone must
adulate me,

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.790
and that will cause you to,

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.880
to behave wrongly in adapting
to the problem.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.980
Those kind of things.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.480
I think I have one last
question.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.940
The woman in the back?

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.990
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a great co-founding
team.

00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:56.990
And from your perspective,
what makes a good partnership

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.239
when you&#39;re evaluating how to
be a great co-founder?

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:00.340
&gt;&gt; Co-founding team,

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.010
how to evaluate, and then how
to think about co-founders.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.650
So the first thing is,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.600
it&#39;s super important that you
collaborate really well.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.750
That was the kind of the point
I was making during the team,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.010
the initial part of that.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.900
Because, if you in fact, don&#39;t
have pretty good serious

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:22.320
trust, you know, kind of a way
of.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.460
It&#39;s 150 that I&#39;m supposed to
end, right?

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.040
&gt;&gt; 205, man.
&gt;&gt; Oh 205, no, no, no, no I&#39;ll

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.570
keep going.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.540
Sorry.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.600
I, I, I misread the time.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.890
So, I will have time for more
questions, Sorry,

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:37.460
I was trying to be time
&gt;&gt; So,

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.510
okay, let me give a little bit
longer answer to this, then.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.372
So the key thing is when
you&#39;re thinking about founder,

00:35:42.372 --> 00:35:43.830
founder se, founders is,

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.692
do you have a diversity of the
necessary strengths across

00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:49.030
the whole range of strengths
that would be useful?

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.166
Frequently you need one
technical founder.

00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:53.782
At least frequently, you need
to have someone who is

00:35:53.782 --> 00:35:55.863
going to be dedicated to the
business side,

00:35:55.863 --> 00:35:57.924
fundraising, these sorts of
things.

00:35:57.924 --> 00:35:59.700
That&#39;s.
Kind of classically skill set.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.282
When you think about the two
to three.

00:36:01.282 --> 00:36:05.450
And usually, it&#39;s kind of some
composition across them.

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:07.420
And that&#39;s kind of, like what
you think of as founders one

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.250
when you&#39;re thinking about a
founding team when you

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.750
get the next level deep.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.940
For example, one of the things
that

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.360
people will classically tell
you is like for

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.720
example don&#39;t invest in a
husband and wife team.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.260
And actually, that&#39;s look
like, that adds a little extra

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.190
freight to it and everything
else cause, you know,

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.130
there&#39;s personal dynamics also
upset what&#39;s going on.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.260
I actually think that what
you&#39;re looking for is do they

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.540
collaborate well, do they help
each other get to truth.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.580
Okay, so for example I.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.430
Most heartened when I&#39;m
talking to a team that when

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.490
they&#39;re, when they&#39;re
reasoning to each other,

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:44.050
they&#39;re not like oh,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.420
we&#39;re just all singing from
the same thing.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.190
It&#39;s like oh, well did you
think of this or

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.280
what about this is a
challenge.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.650
Like you&#39;re navigating the
field of

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.500
battle which has a bunch of
risks.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.520
Like for example, one of the
things that was pretty common

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.610
in PayPal is Max who invented
the prod systems and

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.890
everything else would
frequently come into

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.820
Peter&#39;s office, Peter Thiel,
mass legend and say,

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.690
look here is some things that
are going to kill us and

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.470
let me focus you on them.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.770
Right so, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re
all just kind of saying,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.760
oh yes, we&#39;re all sitting here
We are adjusting to what is

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.940
truth and what&#39;s the problem
we need to solve,

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:15.880
what&#39;s the problem in the
short term,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.950
what&#39;s the problem in the long
term and

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.320
how are we tackling it?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.620
And that composition within
the team that collective

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.360
problem solving, that
collective learning is the

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.880
kind of thing that actually
usually makes great teams.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you for this
wonderful lecture.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.270
I recall Peter Thiel says, we
all dream of flying cars, but

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.430
we end up 140 characters.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.040
So let&#39;s ask you, you know,
how to identify.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.130
That we found this, you know
different sectors that someone

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.921
might would be you.

00:37:45.921 --> 00:37:46.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; And

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:51.630
then some of the, the common
computing or how to,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.830
how to poll outsiders or the
to for the combination.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.080
&gt;&gt; Yup.
&gt;&gt; Is there a common place or

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.040
any
&gt;&gt; So different founders,

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.730
different areas, how do you
identify them?

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.660
So.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.600
The talk was aimed at kind of
what is unique about

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.250
the mindset I think of
founders.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:11.880
That is a great founder across
all founders.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.190
That&#39;s part of what this was.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.340
An attempt to say look because
there are difference.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.300
So for example in software,
speed to market,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.480
speed to learning is really
key.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.460
In hardware, if you **** it
up, you&#39;re dead.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.150
So, accuracy really matters.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:32.490
So if you build and ship the
wrong thing, you&#39;re hosed.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.080
Generally speaking, as an
investor, and

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.730
this is part of the reason why
a lot of investors, you know,

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:40.410
have a certain set of things
that they then

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.320
learn pretty well and try to
reapply because they try to

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.100
understand a domain well
enough to be able to identify.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.420
Which of the founders in this
domain that really matter and

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.950
if we&#39;re investing in this
domain,

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:49.850
how do we do that well?

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:58.220
And so there are attributes
that are unique per domain.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.232
So, for example,

00:38:59.232 --> 00:39:03.930
you know, like if like one of
the classic ones is

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.530
how good must you be at
operational efficiencies in

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.560
terms of margins, cost
controls, etcetera.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.740
You&#39;re dealing in the worlds
of atoms including even in

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.990
commerce, you&#39;ve gotta be
really good at that.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.890
You&#39;re doing a digital game
like

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.430
a Zinga-like startup doesn&#39;t
matter at all.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.170
Right.
So, and so you look for

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.800
that kind of fix and
proclivities, and

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.600
part of the beginning of this
is, it&#39;s not action fact that

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.590
it&#39;s one person is good at
everything.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.870
I would be, like, one of the
funniest conversations I

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:32.450
had with a guy, a friend of
mine who worked for

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.480
me at my first start-up&#39;s
social net.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.110
He looked at me and he said,

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:38.510
Reed, I would never hire you
to be a manager of McDonald&#39;s.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.370
I&#39;m like yeah, I wouldn&#39;t
either.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:42.240
I&#39;d be terrible at that.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.210
Right, and so it&#39;s, it&#39;s the
skill set that fits, but

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.930
also the whole point of this
is actually being

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:51.100
navigating a set of things
that look like paradoxes.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.180
Sometimes being heavy on one,
sometimes heavy on the other.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.610
And being, having the right
judgement at the moment in

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.570
terms of what you&#39;re doing.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.999
And that&#39;s what tends to be
more universal.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.573
You mentioned that you&#39;re
taking longer then you&#39;d like

00:40:06.573 --> 00:40:09.570
to see growing and speak a
little bit about when,

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.419
how do you know whether or not
you should say and

00:40:12.419 --> 00:40:16.437
how do you know when to give
up on also maybe with respect

00:40:16.437 --> 00:40:19.467
to like your personalize life
and career goals.

00:40:19.467 --> 00:40:21.350
How it fits in
&gt;&gt; So

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.590
the question is basically how
do you know when to pivot?

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.260
Part of the reason why having
investment thesis and

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.910
your confidence in your
investment thesis and

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.025
being pretty clear on that is,

00:40:31.025 --> 00:40:34.940
generally speaking,the answer
that I give people is

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.100
if you&#39;re confidence is
unmeasured for a fairly long

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.820
time or is decreasing, cause
unmeasured for a fairly long

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.850
time should be decreasing and
it&#39;s decreasing.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.160
And then you go into intense
mode where you&#39;re trying to

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.550
figure out what kinds of
things you would do

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.810
that would increase your
confidence.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.110
Right, and that&#39;s failing.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.350
That&#39;s a seriously good time
to think about pivoting Right.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.680
And you might have thesis on
can we raise money.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.700
You might have thesis on will,
what&#39;s the pattern by

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.350
which the product distribution
and growth or, you know,

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.300
viral limitation or SEO or
anything else will work.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.250
And just like, well, I tried
these things and

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.670
this fourth thing doesn&#39;t seem
as good as these three and

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.430
the next two things that I
think about.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.340
So even worse that begins to
decrease your confidence and

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.510
that&#39;s when you should think
about pivoting.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.860
A frequent mistake when it
comes to pivoting is

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.995
wait until you&#39;ve essentially
been crashed into the wall and

00:41:28.995 --> 00:41:31.829
everything is dead and you
can&#39;t make any and you can&#39;t

00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:34.619
maneuver anymore and that&#39;s
you waited way too long.

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:38.219
Now, in terms of personal
career goals and so

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:41.533
forth, you know, part of the
thing that I

00:41:41.533 --> 00:41:45.889
would say that is one of the
things that I meant to talk to

00:41:45.889 --> 00:41:49.964
you during the slides that
since misread the time,

00:41:49.964 --> 00:41:52.658
I rushed through it a little
bit.

00:41:52.658 --> 00:41:55.494
One of the classic questions
is balance and

00:41:55.494 --> 00:41:58.910
I actually think founders have
no balance.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.540
Like one of the funniest
conversations I

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.280
ever had was with a governor
of Colorado who was

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.200
we&#39;re going to attract really
great entrepreneurs here

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.517
because we have this balanced
lifestyle.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.800
Like, like literally if I ever
hear a founder talking about

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.020
oh this is how I have a
balanced life and so.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.250
They&#39;re not committed to
winning, right?

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:18.120
And so the only really great
founders are like,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.060
I am going to literally pour
everything into doing this.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.510
Now, it only may be for a
couple years.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.430
I may do this for a while,
then go do other things.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.532
But while I&#39;m doing this, I am
unbalanced at this thing.

00:42:27.532 --> 00:42:29.087
It&#39;s not to say you don&#39;t take
breaks,

00:42:29.087 --> 00:42:31.051
not to say that you don&#39;t, you
know, go on dates or

00:42:31.051 --> 00:42:32.060
whatever else.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:34.160
But you&#39;re super focused on
this,

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.340
because it&#39;s really hard, and
there&#39;s lots of ways to die.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.070
And that&#39;s the reason why the
jumping off the cliff

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.050
metaphor is one of the ones
that I classically use.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.665
&gt;&gt; So your definition of
sorry, depends on

00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:48.504
the idea of identifying
uncertain opportunities which

00:42:48.504 --> 00:42:51.000
others don&#39;t necessarily see.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.740
Overall how efficient do you
think the startup ecosystem is

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.300
at identifying good
opportunities?

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.600
&gt;&gt; So how good is the startup
ecosystem at

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.873
identifying contrarian
opportunities?

00:43:01.873 --> 00:43:03.610
Let&#39;s see.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.450
That&#39;s kind of challenge.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:06.710
Because the moment it

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.760
kind of actually becomes in
vogue it&#39;s less contrarian.

00:43:10.894 --> 00:43:13.660
I&#39;d say it&#39;s mixed.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:17.316
Sometimes because part of what
makes a great investor is

00:43:17.316 --> 00:43:20.425
an ability to go look I take
this radical shot and

00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:22.153
I take this radical shot.

00:43:22.153 --> 00:43:24.687
I take this radical shot and
there&#39;s enough people or

00:43:24.687 --> 00:43:27.448
investors there&#39;s usually
someone, if you can find your

00:43:27.448 --> 00:43:30.340
way to them, network finding
your way through the network.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.810
Sometimes difficult, tons of
noise,

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:33.630
hard to get to the signal.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.450
On the other hand there&#39;s
sometimes things that

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.520
are just kind of like, you
know, totally crazy.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.270
Like one of the funniest
things is,

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:44.920
you know Benchmark was the
only one that would fund eBay.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.900
You know, if you talk to most
of the people in

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.180
the Valley a year, 18 months
ago about BitCoin they

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.470
would&#39;ve told you like what?

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.110
Bit what?

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:54.730
They have no idea what it is.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:55.490
And by the way,

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.340
it&#39;s still unclear how BitCoin
will play out, although,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.340
I think, the fact that there
will be a distributed

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.950
trust system on cryptocurrency
is I think almost certainly

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.910
going to exist in the world,
and the real question is,

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.700
is BitCoin the first or last
cryptocurrency.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.490
First, there&#39;s new ones and
new features.

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:10.570
Last because it&#39;s the one that
has

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.368
network effects and is already
going.

00:44:12.368 --> 00:44:14.181
And so.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.740
I think it&#39;s pretty good with
it.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.570
Frequently what happens is
people think

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.770
they&#39;re contrarian because
they&#39;re doing something they

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.420
think is a unique con-,

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:29.590
unique combination.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:31.920
I&#39;ll give you two examples and
hopefully the,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.160
the founders of these people
who sent me these cool,

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.420
I get about 30 pictures sent
to me a day.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.530
That I don&#39;t basically don&#39;t
look at unless or

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.010
if something in the title
makes me laugh.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.270
In which case I look at it
mostly as comedy.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.090
And I&#39;ll share two comedy
ones.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:48.280
One of them was wearable
diapers, which was the you

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.380
know, you, you have the
computer monitoring you know.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.340
Whether or not the kid is you
know taking a pee or

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.170
a poop and it lets you know,
and you&#39;re like.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.310
If you&#39;re that far away from
your child in this kind of

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.917
thing, it&#39;s probably a bad
sign of other things.

00:45:00.917 --> 00:45:03.801
And then the other one was
kind of

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:06.512
a customized e-commerce bongs.

00:45:06.512 --> 00:45:08.040
And your know like, oh, I&#39;ve
got a contrarian idea.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:09.510
Like, yes you do.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.110
But not the right way.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:12.240
Right?
So anyway.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.740
So, you know, but, so I think
generally speaking,

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.710
the system&#39;s pretty good at
it.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:17.951
In the back.

00:45:17.951 --> 00:45:21.210
&gt;&gt; Do you find social net
ahead of time I guess.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.040
How do you think about
creating markets versus.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.713
&gt;&gt; Creating markets versus
discovering them?

00:45:25.713 --> 00:45:26.672
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:45:26.672 --> 00:45:30.810
So this is actually, well,
it&#39;s a challenging question.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.780
The, the the, the frequent,
like, and there&#39;s a,

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.760
and it&#39;s a good follow on the
contrarian thing,

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.040
like frequently there&#39;s this
classic thing of,

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.270
oh does the market exist yet?

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.320
Is that because it&#39;s going to
be huge or nonexistent?

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.730
The good news is, it&#39;s usually
one or the other.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:44.510
Right?

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.620
And so that makes going after
something that most people

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.600
don&#39;t think is a market, but

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.690
you have a reason to believe
it,

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:51.570
is actually sometimes
frequently a good bet.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.540
However it can freq,

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.290
it can sometimes completely
flame out.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.100
And one of the things you&#39;re
doing when you&#39;re testing your

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.580
investment thesis is.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.650
What would lead me to

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.010
think whether there was a
market there or not?

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:05.360
Because, you know,

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.800
at the beginning there are no
markets.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.690
And so it is of course
conceptually possible to

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:10.230
create markets.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:12.370
People think that there&#39;s a
new need for

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.540
this sort of thing.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:14.120
On the other hand,

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.460
the problem is how do you get
fast adoption if people don&#39;t

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.950
even know that they want it as
a category.

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:19.600
Right?

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.920
So they say, well, but people,

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.470
they just realize, a classic
entrepreneurial misfire.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:27.800
A classic one is if people
just realize once it

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.780
exists they&#39;ll realize they
really love it and

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.860
they&#39;ll, they&#39;ll line up in
droves for it.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.240
Well, there&#39;s a few
entrepreneurs,

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.570
Steve Jobs one of them, who
can do that.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.750
Most of the time it doesn&#39;t
work out that way, and so

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.390
you have to say in your
investment thesis why is

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.150
it that you think when you&#39;re
thinking about a market that

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.100
isn&#39;t already existent.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.600
That, that you know that other
people don&#39;t know on

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.560
the countrian basis that leads
you to

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.290
think that market should
exist, right.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:55.420
And so for example, a micro
one with LinkedIn was,

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.080
actually in fact the
classifieds means of

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.070
recruiting was in fact an
exercise of newspapers,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.060
an exercise in information
age.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.380
And actually, recruiting
direct to people is part of

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.180
what the networked age, and
the internet and

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.800
that&#39;s actually, in fact, how
recruiting should go.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.010
Now, it was relatively easy to
validate that.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:14.820
But, you know,

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.150
that&#39;s the kind of thing where
you think about,

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.190
there&#39;s potentially a new
market.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:19.240
&gt;&gt; Last question, boss.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, last question.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.080
&gt;&gt; When do you know you&#39;ve
known someone long enough to

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.890
start a company in front of?

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:27.030
One of the things Stan told us
a in the first semester was

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.740
you someone you know for a but
when you guys started PayPal.

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.238
Like, for example, how long
did you,

00:47:33.238 --> 00:47:36.568
it was a large group of people
so how do you know okay,

00:47:36.568 --> 00:47:39.474
I trust the people enough to
start a company.

00:47:39.474 --> 00:47:41.456
&gt;&gt; So the read I&#39;m, I&#39;m, I&#39;m
repeating the question in

00:47:41.456 --> 00:47:43.312
part because we&#39;re, this is
record, recorded and

00:47:43.312 --> 00:47:45.379
everything else and I want to
make sure the people here it,

00:47:45.379 --> 00:47:47.233
but the question basically is
how do you know that you

00:47:47.233 --> 00:47:49.490
trust someone well enough to
be a cofounder.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.270
There&#39;s a whole bunch of
different variables that go

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:55.000
into it and, look, it&#39;s one of
the risks that you take.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.780
And you kind of get to a
thesis of do I think that I

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.570
know them well enough?

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.360
Now I&#39;ll parallel one thing
that I think

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.010
there&#39;s a parallel here that I
think is super useful.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.130
So one of the things I tell my
portfolio company CEOs or

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.060
founders when there thinking
about hiring a CEO.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.270
Is I think that the only way
to do this is,

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.350
when you get down to the
people that you thinking you

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:22.160
may hire as a CEO, you spend
20 plus hours which them.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.690
Right, where you go into as
much depth in a conversation

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.510
about anything you think is a
possible difference.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.710
Of opinion, belief, work
style, so

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:35.720
you&#39;ve identified all this up
front so that you&#39;re, you&#39;re,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.960
you&#39;re it&#39;s not that you have
a contract, it&#39;s not like,

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.120
oh signing a contract, this is
how we do it.

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.910
But we&#39;ve established the
conversation.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:43.830
We&#39;ve, we&#39;ve gone all the
parameters,

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.420
we&#39;ve had a conversion about
what we might agree with or

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.570
disagree with.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.680
One of the things that I
frequently think is

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.960
worth covering is almost like,
kind of, the divorce.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.480
Like, wa, why would we want to
divorce?

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.770
Like, what would lead me to
say,

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:56.350
this isn&#39;t working, right?

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.230
And to cover that up front as
part of it.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:59.960
Because then, at that point,

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.510
when you get into the field of
battle.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.720
Which is hugely stressful,

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.600
you go through this valley
shadow of the moment.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.030
You&#39;ve at least got the basis
of we already conversed about

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.690
a wide variety of things we&#39;ve
set up essentially some

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.960
expectations about what, you
know how we might be planning

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.790
together, and if it begins to
vary off that it&#39;s relatively

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.070
easy to bring it up in a way
that you&#39;re problem solving.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.210
And that&#39;s the kind of thing
that I think you frequently,

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:23.040
you should be fairly confident
that you

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.820
have that level of trust.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.920
For me, frequently,

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.320
it&#39;s to have a set of robust
conversations.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.370
Such that, as like, like if
something comes up later,

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:32.240
it&#39;s like, well, we talked
about this inversion.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.300
And we can, we can bring that
up, so.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.780
Anyway, with that.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.690
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:37.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

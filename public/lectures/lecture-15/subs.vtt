00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.280
So when Sam originally sent me
an email to do this course,

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.400
he said Ben can you teach a 15
minute course on management.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.980
And I immediately thought to
myself, wow,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.220
I just wrote a 300 page book
on management, so

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.120
that book was entirely too
long.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.800
And I, I didn&#39;t actually have
time to collapse the 300 pages

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.390
into 50 minutes.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.540
So like Mark Twain, I didn&#39;t
have time to write

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.240
a good short letter, so I&#39;m
going to write a long letter.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.560
But in this case,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.900
I&#39;m going to teach exactly one
management concept.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.360
So, one long thing.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.610
And this management concept
though,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.000
is the thing that I see CEOs
mess up more consistently than

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.560
anything else, and from when
they&#39;re very,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.740
very early to when they&#39;re
very, very big as a company.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.620
It&#39;s the easiest thing to say,
and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.810
the most difficult to master.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.774
And, the concept in musical
form, whoops, pardon me,

00:00:56.774 --> 00:00:58.210
very sensitive.

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:04.100
But musical form.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.070
This is from Sly And The
Family Stone.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.400
Sometimes I&#39;m right.

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:18.761
&gt;&gt; So.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.597
No difference what group I&#39;m
in.

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:33.310
So that&#39;s, that&#39;s the musical
version of today&#39;s lesson.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.300
For those of you, you are
musical, you can leave now.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.210
In management concept form,
basically it&#39;s this.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.680
When you&#39;re making a critical
decision,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.600
you have to understand how
it&#39;s going to be interpreted

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.670
from all points of view, not
just your point of view and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.600
not just the person you&#39;re
talking to, but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.800
to people who aren&#39;t in the
room, everybody else.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.700
In other words, you really
have to be able, when

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.600
making critical decisions, to
see the decision.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.740
Through the eyes of the
company, and the company as

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.290
a whole, which means you&#39;ve
got to kind of add up

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.530
every employee&#39;s view, and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.720
then incorporate that into
your own view, otherwise your

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.580
management decisions are going
to have have very weird,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.620
side effects and,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.230
and potentially very dangerous
consequences.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.390
And it&#39;s a really hard thing
to do,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.070
because at the point when
you&#39;re making

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.960
a decision you&#39;re often under
a great deal of pressure.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.070
So let&#39;s get into the agenda.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.830
So I&#39;m going to cover a kind
of four cases,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.130
first I&#39;m going to cover
demotions,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.260
which is a very emotional
thing.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.680
Then raises, which is also an
emotional thing.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.390
Then we&#39;re going to evaluate
one of Sams blog posts.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.370
Which is news to Sam, so I&#39;d
figure out I&#39;d tease him

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.110
since he invited me to a do a
50 minute management class,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.340
after I wrote a 300 page book.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.460
And then I&#39;m going to talk
about,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.520
history&#39;s greatest
practitioner at this, and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.540
I&#39;m wearing a shirt with him
on it, and kind of how he used

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.190
it to do something he has
done, had ever done before in

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.210
human history and has never
done since in human history.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.630
But basically complete
mastery, of,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.000
of the technique I&#39;m going to
talk about.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.830
So, first business example.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.540
You&#39;ve got an executive, and
do you demote, or

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.660
do you fire him?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.900
And this comes from an actual
conversation, an actual real

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.340
life situation that I was
working on with a CEO.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.619
And so, the basic situation
was this.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.340
He had a great executive, or
like an executive who,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.320
just a great effort.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.470
Like, he hired him.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.530
He was working harder than
anybody else in the company,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.580
doing you know, like,
everything he was supposed to.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.470
Everybody liked him, because
he worked so hard, and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.070
like was a general smart
person.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.450
But he was just in over his
head knowledge wise.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.680
He did not have the knowledge
and the skills to basically do

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.320
what the company needed him to
do or,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.580
like, really compete against
the competition, so

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.040
he couldn&#39;t actually keep him
in the job.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.110
But he&#39;s a great guy.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.910
And you know, so the question
is, well.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.810
Should I fire this person?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.670
Or can I just move him into a
lower role and

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.160
bring in a person above him.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.640
And then, like, you know, that
would be real cool.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.720
So, let&#39;s look at how you
kind of make that decision.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.310
So you in this, in this case
this was the CEO, so

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.080
you as a CEO.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.760
So, one like, look, it&#39;s
really hard if somebody comes

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.930
to work everyday like at, you
know, 6 a.m.,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.446
and is like working till 10
p.m.

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:33.980
And like doing it,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.370
like, harder than anybody in
the company.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.590
It&#39;s really hard to just say,
well, sorry, like,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.670
nice effort, but you don&#39;t get
an A for an effort.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.140
You get an F because I fired
you.

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:48.860
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nobody nobody wants to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.740
have that conversation.

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:52.660
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And then, a demotion is

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.750
kind of neat because from the
CEO&#39;s point of view, and this

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.730
is, he&#39;s like, Look, like, we
can keep him in the company.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.590
He works so hard.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.620
He&#39;s a good example of

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.920
somebody who gives a great
effort.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.970
And you know, like, and then
he&#39;s got a lot of

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.730
friends in the company, and
they&#39;re, you know,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.980
from a cultural standpoint
like, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a win,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.838
win because like, he gets to
stay and, and, you know,

00:05:10.838 --> 00:05:13.500
like and then I can bring in
somebody that can solve my

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.240
problem, but I, I don&#39;t have
to create another problem.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.280
And then if you think about it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.180
from the executive&#39;s
perspective,.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.390
And what they would think,
it&#39;s like, well, I,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.000
you know, I don&#39;t want to be
demoted.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.490
But I really don&#39;t want to be
fired,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.850
because if I get fired that&#39;s
a way harder more complicated

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.290
thing to explain to my next
employer than I got demoted.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.510
Like, getting demoted is like,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.280
well, I didn&#39;t really get
demoted, I got a new job.

00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:40.619
&gt;&gt; A smaller title.

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.329
And then, you know, the, the,
the last thing is it enables,

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:47.829
you know, like theoretically,
while, like, you know,

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:50.990
the company, you know, we
value all our employees.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.770
We brought you in.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.700
We made a commitment to you as
an employee.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.980
And, like, we value everybody.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.530
And it kind of

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.210
will enable you to keep
growing with the company.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.680
And so.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.790
You know and this was the kind
of initial conversation I

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.850
had with a CEO and, and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.430
I said well wait a minute, I
said, let me ask you this.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.800
Like what is the,

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.350
what&#39;s the equity package that
this exec has?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.650
And he goes well what do you
mean?

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.200
And I was like,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.480
well like does he have like,
director level compensation,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.070
does he got like a vice
president level compensation?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.020
Does he have a point and a
half?

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.220
Does he have 0.4% or what?

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.640
and, you know?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.860
That kind of gave the CEO
pause.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.200
He&#39;s, like, well, he does have
a point and a half.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.770
And I was, like, okay.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.490
So you&#39;re an engineer in your
company.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.280
How do you feel about somebody
who used to be the head of

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.680
sales, who got brought in with
a point and a half.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.790
Now, mind you, you&#39;re an
engin-,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.950
what do your engineers get?

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.572
Like, they get.

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.510
.1%, .2%, what are they
getting at this point?

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.200
So how are they going to feel
about somebody who&#39;s

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.340
not the head of sales with
1.5% of the company.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.490
And he was like oh.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.890
And I was like, yeah, oh.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.369
Because like how fair is that?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.590
So are you going to take the
equity away, are you up for

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.180
doing that, are you up for
going back and

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.300
taking back his compensation?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.410
And like how productive do

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.710
you think he&#39;ll be if you take
away his compensation?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.620
And then secondly, like Will
people give him

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.051
the same respect now that
you&#39;ve demoted him,

00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:23.767
because they knew him as this,
and now he&#39;s this.

00:07:23.767 --> 00:07:27.121
And so like, I knew you when
you were head of sales,

00:07:27.121 --> 00:07:29.695
now you&#39;re the regional
manager, and

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:32.349
you&#39;re telling me what the to
do?

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.650
You&#39;re telling me I need to
make that call?

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.310
Like, seems to me you got
demoted.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.070
You know, who are you to talk
to me?

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.890
I&#39;m an up and comer.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.930
I&#39;ll be the next VP of sales
at the next company.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.530
So all these things come into
play.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.580
And so when you look out at
the end,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.780
like you may think you&#39;re
dealing with one person.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.510
You may think that this is a
demotion, or a firing of one

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.720
person, and what does it mean
according to that one person.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.980
But what you&#39;re really doing
is you&#39;re saying look.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.660
What does it mean to fail on
the job?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.800
Particularly, a very,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.130
the highest paid, highest
compensated job

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.550
in the company from an equity
standpoint, and then,

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.200
like, what&#39;s required to
maintain your equity?

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.660
Like is it good enough to put
in an effort?

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.650
Or do you have to get a
result.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.420
And in different situations at
different levels, look,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.340
these answers will come out
differently.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.800
And if this had been a person
not that

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.690
was an executive brought in
from the outside but

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.670
was somebody who you maybe
promoted past where they

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.400
should have been, and didn&#39;t
ever get that equity, like,

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.140
maybe you make a different
decision.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.550
But you&#39;ve gotta understand
what it&#39;s going to mean to

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.080
everybody, not just the person
you&#39;re talking to.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.680
Example two.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.190
An excellent employee asks for
a raise.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.600
Good employee.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.750
This isn&#39;t like a, like the
last employee.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.930
This is like really good
employee.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.570
So excellent employee asks for
a raise.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.490
So, look.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.760
Your first thing is like,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.760
they&#39;re really good, they
asked me for

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.910
a raise, they didn&#39;t ask me
for no reason.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.320
They ask me because they think
they deserve it.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.070
I want to retain them.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.020
Like, I want to be fair.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.980
They&#39;ve done a great job.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.430
I want to be fair, and, like,
you know,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.900
I know that if I give them
this raise, like,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.280
it&#39;s going to be all love
coming my way,.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.945
That&#39;s going to be if I gave
you a raise, we&#39;re good,

00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:16.470
you know, like we&#39;re boys.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.320
&gt;&gt; Look at you.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:19.849
You got a raise.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.650
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s awesome.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.870
So like, you know from your
perspective you know what you

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.200
want to do when somebody asks
you for a raise.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.880
And then if you look at it,
okay, so

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.470
what about from their
perspective, what,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.850
how would they, like, take it
if you gave them the raise.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.020
And now you have to remember
the employee from, for

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.400
them to get to the point where
they&#39;ve asked you for a raise.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.620
This is not something they
just like woke up one

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.940
morning and like, I&#39;m going in
and asking for a raise, right?

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.363
Like this is something where
they&#39;ve thought about it

00:09:48.363 --> 00:09:50.996
a lot, they&#39;ve you know,
compared their other options,

00:09:50.996 --> 00:09:53.472
they may have an offer from
another company, you know,

00:09:53.472 --> 00:09:55.895
they&#39;re, it&#39;s something their
spouse probably has

00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:57.181
been talking to them about.

00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:59.470
And so it&#39;s a serious thing.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.530
And so, if you give it to
them,

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.370
they&#39;re very likely to feel
very good about it.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:04.770
Like, they may be like
paranoid,

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.200
about like why are you giving
me a raise?

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.141
But, very unlikely.

00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.491
Much more and they&#39;ll feel
like.

00:10:34.456 --> 00:10:36.187
I&#39;m sorry, I have to just let
the whole thing play.

00:10:43.099 --> 00:10:44.133
And that&#39;s, that&#39;s for

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.368
those of you who don&#39;t know,
that&#39;s Bobby Shmurda.

00:10:46.368 --> 00:10:47.286
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And,

00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:50.645
Rowdy Rebel doing the Shmoney
Dance.

00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:51.265
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But that&#39;s,

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:52.612
that&#39;s likely the reaction
you&#39;ll get.

00:10:52.612 --> 00:10:55.040
So there&#39;s a lot of momentum
to say yes, look,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.199
they read Sheryll&#39;s book, they
leaned in and I&#39;m going to

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.260
reward them for, for doing all
that, which is, you know?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.360
And, and by the way, that book
has very good advice,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.424
so I&#39;m, I&#39;m not knocking on
that.

00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:09.042
I don&#39;t want you to be
misinterpreting me.

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:11.970
however, you know, there was
going to be a however.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.112
What about, you have to think
about it through the point of

00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:16.946
view of the employee who did
not ask for the raise.

00:11:19.018 --> 00:11:23.018
So the employee who didn&#39;t for
the raise, they may be doing

00:11:23.018 --> 00:11:27.365
a better job than the employee
who did do, ask for the raise.

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:30.472
And in their mind they&#39;re
going, okay, so I didn&#39;t ask

00:11:30.472 --> 00:11:33.448
for a raise and I didn&#39;t get a
raise, and they asked for

00:11:33.448 --> 00:11:36.920
a raise and they got a raise,
and so what does that mean?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.150
That means one, like you&#39;re
not

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.570
really evaluating people&#39;s
performance.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.650
You&#39;re just going well whoever
asks, gets.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.220
So that means like, I either
need to be that guy,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.790
who asks for the raise.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.868
Like and I, I, you know,

00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:52.926
that&#39;s just no how I feel you
know, I do my work and

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:55.260
I don&#39;t necessarily want to
ask for a raise.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.990
Or like I should, I just need
to quit and go to

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.240
a company that like actually
evaluates performance.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.110
And then you know, so you
could really make the person

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.980
who doesn&#39;t get the raise feel
like, pretty pissy about it.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.490
And don&#39;t think that when
somebody&#39;s walking down your

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.010
company doing the shmoney
dance that

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.220
other people aren&#39;t going to
notice, like.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.300
So they&#39;re going to be fired
up about that raise.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.600
They&#39;re saying, oh you can
say, oh this is

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.480
highly confidential that I&#39;m
giving you this raise.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.246
It&#39;s not confidential.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.820
And then the cultural
conclusion is going to

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.740
be everybody in your company
is going to feel that

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.160
they now have a fiduciary
responsibility to their

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.040
family to ask for a raise all
of the time.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.270
Because if they don&#39;t, then
they may be missing out on

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.780
a raise that they would have
otherwise gotten.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.930
And like you talk to any
experienced CEO and

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.370
they will tell you this is
true.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.030
Like if you give out raises
when people just ask you for

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.380
them, like that,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.530
you will have a lot of people
asking you for raises.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.110
That is called encouraging
behavior.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.600
So what do you do?

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.970
And really, the right answer
on raises is you have

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.460
to be formal.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.440
And you have to be formal to
save your own culture.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.400
And I know this is always,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.850
this is the thing that causes
people running startups, fits.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.360
Because, it&#39;s,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.790
like, well, I don&#39;t want,
like, a lot of formalities.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.030
I don&#39;t want a lot of process.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.270
I want it to be organic.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.280
We want to do yoga.

00:13:23.064 --> 00:13:23.862
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; We want to

00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:25.801
only smoke organic weed.

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:30.586
Sorry that was like a Peter.

00:13:30.586 --> 00:13:33.988
Peter got very focused on

00:13:33.988 --> 00:13:40.643
who was smokin&#39; weed a little
while ago.

00:13:40.643 --> 00:13:45.114
But like, the process actually
protects it

00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:50.238
protects the culture because
what it does it says look,

00:13:50.238 --> 00:13:53.850
we&#39;re going to look at all the
inputs.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.250
We&#39;re going to have a formal
way of saying anybody who

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.890
wants a raise come talk to me.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.430
Like, I&#39;m not going to give
you a raise, but

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:02.750
I&#39;m happy to hear your story.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.860
I&#39;m going to talk to all the
people you work with so

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.750
I get like a, understanding of
it.

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.664
I&#39;m going to evaluate all the
work that you&#39;ve done so

00:14:10.664 --> 00:14:12.909
I know like, where I actually
rate you, and

00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:14.560
what my actual opinion on
them.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.734
I&#39;m going to do that
periodically,

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:17.420
I&#39;m not going to do it daily.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.100
But like yeah, maybe if I were
fast moving I&#39;ll do it

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.540
ever six months or even maybe
once a quarter.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.870
And at the end of that process
I

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.850
will tell you want your raise
is.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.490
And I will tell you if you&#39;re
getting one of if you&#39;re not

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.870
getting one, but I&#39;m not
going to do things off cycle.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.772
I&#39;m not going to do things
when asked.

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.949
There&#39;s like one process, and
that&#39;s it.

00:14:35.949 --> 00:14:37.980
And I, you know, when I used
to be CEO, and

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.635
I had, like, executive, it&#39;s
the bigger this gets,

00:14:40.635 --> 00:14:42.386
the harder this gets because
the more

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:45.090
aggressive the people working
for you are.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.000
Because to get to be an
executive, it turns out,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.720
you often have to be pretty
aggressive in this world.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.790
And in most companies, like,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.050
that&#39;s how you get to that
level.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.400
You know, I would go, like,
you can lobby me all you want,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.710
you know, after the process is
done, and

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.960
I give you your raise, but you
know what?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.040
I&#39;m not hearing it,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.620
because I already went through
my process.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.730
I got your input going in.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.160
I got everybody else&#39;s input,
I&#39;ve got so many people,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.060
I&#39;ve got so much money and you
got what I believe is right.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.217
And having a process like that
basically gets people to be

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:20.391
actually more comfortable.

00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:22.683
They&#39;re more comfortable
because they don&#39;t always have

00:15:22.683 --> 00:15:24.760
to be on edge about like am I
asking for what I deserve?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.166
Or am I getting like aced out
because of who I am,

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:28.069
what I look like,

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:31.090
I&#39;m not buddy buddy, I&#39;m not
at the golf course with you.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.060
Or I&#39;m not doing whatever you
like to do.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.330
Or, you know?

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.815
I don&#39;t have to worry about
any of that.

00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:36.880
&#39;because I know your process.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.770
I know your processes like
you&#39;re going to evaluate

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.410
everybody, and then you&#39;re
going to give &#39;em what&#39;s fair.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.710
And so that&#39;s a, a much better
way to handle that.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.770
And it means that you&#39;re
actually understanding what

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:47.860
everybody thinks.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.490
Not just the people you&#39;re
talking to at the moment.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.588
Okay, so now we&#39;re going to
get into some fun stuff.

00:15:52.588 --> 00:15:56.290
We&#39;re going to evaluate Sam&#39;s
blog post, how.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.151
Which is actually, there are
some very good things in it.

00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:02.855
And then there are some things
I&#39;m going to discuss.

00:16:02.855 --> 00:16:03.736
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So Sam, so

00:16:03.736 --> 00:16:06.222
this is the expert, excerpt.

00:16:06.222 --> 00:16:09.813
Most employees have nine, only
90 days after they leave a job

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:11.450
to exercise their options.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.000
Unfortunately, this requires
money to

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.850
cover the strike price and the
tax bill.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.570
I&#39;ll explain this a little
later, just.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.550
But I want to read it first.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.249
For the year of exercise,
blah, blah, blah,

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:24.821
this is often more cash than
an employee has.

00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:26.060
And this is the key.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.002
And so the employee has to
choose between like, leaving

00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:32.132
the job and walking away from
the invested options of either

00:16:32.132 --> 00:16:35.200
money that she has because she
can&#39;t afford to exercise or

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.330
being like locked into staying
at the company basically for

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.660
all the wrong reasons.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.699
So particularly bad

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:43.143
situation when an employee
gets terminated and

00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:45.782
I&#39;ll get into that and that&#39;s
a really key point.

00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:48.711
This doesn&#39;t seem fair, the
best solution I have heard is

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:52.060
from Adam D&#39;Angelo, a very,
very smart guy at Quora.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.520
The idea is to grant options
that are exercisable for

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.780
ten years from the grant date,
which should cover,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.700
you know like, all the cases
you know,

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.560
whatever happens with the
company.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.110
There are some tricky issues
to this.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.500
Blah, blah, blah.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.060
But it&#39;s still far better than
just losing the assets.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.050
I think this is a policy that
all startups should adopt.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.690
So our question is well, like,
was Sam right?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.800
Is this a policy that all
startups should adopt.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.827
So let me first explain again
what the policy is.

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:21.130
So currently the way almost
every stock option package in

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.443
Silicon Valley works and in
all of startup world is this.

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:29.793
That your stock vests, you get
stock invest over a period of

00:17:29.793 --> 00:17:32.664
time but if you leave the
company,

00:17:32.664 --> 00:17:37.014
when you leave you have, and
it depends on the company, but

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:41.464
I think it&#39;s 90 days to
exercise, so yeah, so 90 days.

00:17:41.464 --> 00:17:45.333
And if you do not buy your
stock in that period,

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:48.300
Like it&#39;s not yours anymore.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.470
Which, depending on when you
entered the company,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.490
could be a big problem.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.180
So a lot of companies today
that are valued a lot,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.200
like if you take like a really
valuable startup like say

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.900
an Airbnb, or an Uber, or
something like that.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.770
When they bring you in, they
go wow, you know?

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.310
Like if you look at your 409A
price.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.330
And to the preferred price.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.720
Like the stock we&#39;re giving
your right now,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.242
the options are already worth
like $10 million.

00:18:11.242 --> 00:18:13.690
And you&#39;re like, whoa, $10
million.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.220
I&#39;m rich.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.930
But what they don&#39;t
necessarily tell you is,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:19.840
in order for you to get that
money.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.570
Because their,

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.810
the preferred is worth $10
million, your options probably

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.390
are going to cost you like
$2.5 million.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.090
When you leave, and

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.010
if you don&#39;t have that $2.5
million in 90 days, it&#39;s gone.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:34.602
Like you just lost all your
money.

00:18:34.602 --> 00:18:38.460
And so Sam was like, wow,
that&#39;s **** up.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.917
&gt;&gt; And so he wrote a blog
post.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.470
&gt;&gt; And he said everybody
should change it.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.440
And so the first question that
you have to

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:50.950
ask yourself on something like
this is well why is that even,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.180
like this has kind of been
around since like the 80s so

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.400
why is a rule like this around
for 30 years.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.780
And it turned out, Sam, and I
don&#39;t even,

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.680
I, I don&#39;t know whether he
like figured this our or

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.260
just intuited it, but he was
right.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.960
Like something actually had
changed.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.850
So up until 2004 there used to
be this law called,

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.810
APB opinion number 25.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:20.250
That law was the old way to
account for stock options.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.034
And, you know,

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:23.447
it&#39;s also the law that all the
guys went to jail on.

00:19:23.447 --> 00:19:28.247
So I got a lot of people who
cut a case on APB 25.

00:19:28.247 --> 00:19:29.200
So I&#39;m glad it&#39;s gone.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.100
because it was a very
confusing law.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.860
And a lot of people did not
understand it.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.040
And they literally went to
jail.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.810
But when that was a law,

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.180
if you gave somebody ten years
to exercise their

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.490
options you would never have
been able to go public.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.820
And you would never have been
able to be acquired.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.330
Because you basically were
taking an expense that was

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.530
tied to your stock price.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.100
So basically, the more your
stock went up,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.380
the more compensation expense
you&#39;d have to take.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.710
And the worst thing about it
would be,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.310
is, you wouldn&#39;t know what it
was going to be.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.950
So it&#39;d be totally
unpredictable.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.590
So you could never forecast
earnings ever.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.190
Because your earnings would be
a function of

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.910
all of your stock price.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.340
And so the more your stock
price went up

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.160
the more money you would lose.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.600
And in those days people did
not look through expe,

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.850
stock option expenses.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.460
So like it just wasn&#39;t doable.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.870
And that&#39;s why

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.750
everybody&#39;s agreement was
written at 90 days.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.400
So that&#39;s why it&#39;s there.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.830
So absolutely it&#39;s the right
thing to

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.680
question it being there.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.650
Are you guys following?

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.250
You get this?

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.274
This is like more complicated
than the first two examples

00:20:39.274 --> 00:20:40.666
but a very important one.

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:42.157
Okay.

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:44.205
Then so your perspective on
this,

00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:47.250
if you&#39;ve got employees, you
want to be fair.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.920
Like nobody wants to like
higher, hey,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.010
you&#39;ve got all this stock in
four years, psych.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.130
And especially like when you
fire someone.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:54.930
Hey, you&#39;re fired!

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.065
I feel real bad about it, but,
you know, guess what?

00:20:58.065 --> 00:20:59.673
I&#39;m also going to take all
your money too.

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:02.991
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You must not feel that bad.

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:04.689
So, like, that&#39;s kind of.

00:21:04.689 --> 00:21:05.610
Like a problem.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:06.775
But you also, and

00:21:06.775 --> 00:21:10.043
this is the thing that you&#39;ve
got to keep in mind.

00:21:10.043 --> 00:21:12.173
You also have to think about
the people who are staying,

00:21:12.173 --> 00:21:14.740
and you want to reward the
people who are staying.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.080
Now the employee,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.460
the perspective of the
employee who leaves.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.340
And this is really critical
because,

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.320
this is your reputation,
right?

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.900
Like, I worked.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.700
Like, you know, a year&#39;s work.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.990
Like, where&#39;s my year&#39;s pay?

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.980
And then, okay, so

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.270
now you&#39;re telling me about
this 90 day exercise.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.050
And I know it was in,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.480
like, the fine print of my
stock option agreement.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.750
But, my hiring manager never
told me about that.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.720
They never told me I was
going to

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.017
need like $2 million to get my
stock, which I don&#39;t have.

00:21:43.017 --> 00:21:45.870
And like so if I was rich,
like, I&#39;d get my stock.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.340
Like, that&#39;s not fair.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.080
And so, like, you know, now
I&#39;m fired, and

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.720
then I&#39;m screwed.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.220
And guess what?

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.120
You know, I&#39;m going to tell
everybody like, how you like,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:56.970
screwed me over.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.960
And so that&#39;s a real
reputational problem.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.053
So that&#39;s something that
you&#39;ve gotta consider in

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:01.961
setting this policy.

00:22:04.063 --> 00:22:04.923
But then you also have to

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:06.177
consider the employee who
stays.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.193
And, one thing that they&#39;re
going to ask themselves is,

00:22:11.193 --> 00:22:12.617
look they&#39;re leaving.

00:22:12.617 --> 00:22:15.673
And every time anybody leaves
it&#39;s like, was that smart?

00:22:15.673 --> 00:22:17.291
Like that&#39;s something you,

00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:19.038
because these are people who
write,

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:22.870
your employees know each other
better than they know you.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.600
In any company, I don&#39;t care
what company you are.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.550
But like often the,

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.030
the person they&#39;re really
working with is,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.760
is going to be the person they
know more.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.220
And so if that person leaves
they are going to go,

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.130
well like, should&#39;ve I left
too?

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.040
Like, what did they get,

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.690
and how does that compare to
my deal?

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:44.447
And so, like, if we look at
the situation, and we try and

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:47.540
analyze it, there is a lot of
components to it.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.354
So first is,

00:22:48.354 --> 00:22:51.611
look, companies tread a lot of
people around here.

00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:52.342
And I think, like,

00:22:52.342 --> 00:22:54.105
really the average is
somewhere around 10%,

00:22:54.105 --> 00:22:55.314
it&#39;s probably getting higher.

00:22:55.314 --> 00:22:57.433
Particularly if you&#39;re in San
Francisco,

00:22:57.433 --> 00:22:58.584
it&#39;s getting higher.

00:22:58.584 --> 00:23:00.953
Just because of the nature of
the culture there.

00:23:00.953 --> 00:23:04.490
And then, Silicon Valley
companies dilute,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:08.761
like 6 to 8 or even 10% a year
for employee options.

00:23:08.761 --> 00:23:12.705
And you have to keep in mind
that, as mean as it may be,

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:17.203
if that employee leaves and
can&#39;t exercise their options.

00:23:17.203 --> 00:23:19.688
Then those options come back
to the pool, where you can

00:23:19.688 --> 00:23:22.970
potentially give them to
people who are already there.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.910
So, you&#39;re actually taking
less dilution.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.140
So that&#39;s something that you
have to think about.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.320
I&#39;m not saying you have to act
on it,

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.522
but it&#39;s something that you
have to think about.

00:23:32.522 --> 00:23:35.110
Then secondly, look,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.160
losing all your stock is a
very big incentive to stay.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.840
And that can be good news or
bad news, right?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.130
Like, it can be good news in
that like,

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.710
you get to keep somebody you
might have lost.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.160
It could be bad news in that
you kept them for

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.585
the exact wrong reason, right?

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:48.370
because they have handcuffs on
them.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.450
And so you know, you may get
like,

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.020
the an employee who&#39;s worse
than not having an employee.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.540
But on the other hand,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.100
a ten year option on a highly
volatile security, for

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.480
those of you who have taken
that class.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.660
Anybody taking that class?

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.110
That&#39;s valuable, right?

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.310
Ten years options are
volatility and length.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.470
That&#39;s the value of an option.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.150
Well, ten years on a start up
stock,

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.930
that&#39;s a big valuable thing.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.680
And then remember,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.180
the employee who stays doesn&#39;t
get that.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.610
The employee who stays just
gets the stock.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.850
They get that, but they don&#39;t
get the new job and

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:22.590
the new stock.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.930
So they get one thing but they
don&#39;t get both things.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.320
And so, you&#39;ve gotta weigh
that in.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.240
So this is a hard one.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.220
Like, I think that it should
be

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.980
reevaluated by every company.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.960
I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say
it should be adopted by

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.740
every company.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.980
I think you have to think
about what you want.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.220
And I would just offer kind of

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.510
two alternative cultural
statements.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.540
One is, look we treat
employees with

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.200
the utmost
straightforwardness.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.460
We&#39;re going to be fair.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.120
And therefore,

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.960
like you get ten years to
exercise your stock.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.500
And like what we said we&#39;re
going to give you,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.360
you&#39;re going to get regardless
of how rich or poor you are.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.490
Like, that&#39;s just a done deal.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.280
The second way to handle it,
which is,

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.720
and no companies do this.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.920
Which is why I actually really
like this post that he wrote.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.450
Like, you can say up front,
like,

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.590
you&#39;re guaranteed to get your
salary.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.050
But for your stock to be
meaningful, like, this,

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.310
these are the things that have
to happen.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.260
One, you&#39;ve gotta vest.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.870
Two, you have to stay until,
like, we get to an exit,

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:21.940
like the company makes it.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.160
And or, like you&#39;ve got to
have the money.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.100
And like finally,

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.792
the company&#39;s like actually
got to be worth something.

00:25:28.792 --> 00:25:30.310
because 10% of nothing is
nothing.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.530
And look, the reason that we
set the policy this way is

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.230
like we really value people
who stay.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.690
So don&#39;t join this company
like,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.710
if you&#39;ve got another, join
another one in 18 months.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.390
because like, you&#39;re going to
get screwed.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.230
And like, our policy like
guarantees you&#39;re going to get

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.490
screwed on that.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.280
And so like, those are two
ways to handle it.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.540
It really depends on like, you
and

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.790
how you want to run your
culture.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.260
But again, with all these
things, it&#39;s just critical to

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.890
think it through from
everybody&#39;s perspective.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.440
Because when push comes to
shove, that&#39;s going to matter.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.390
It&#39;s going to change the
outcome of your company.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.197
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m actually revising my
recommendation slightly.

00:26:08.197 --> 00:26:09.108
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s hear it.

00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:11.179
No, I just think there needs
to be more incentive to stay,

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:11.911
through the years.

00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:12.635
But-
&gt;&gt; Right, so

00:26:12.635 --> 00:26:14.080
you could add, you could add a
stay incentive.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.336
&gt;&gt; But still like if someone
gets, if someone gets fired I

00:26:15.336 --> 00:26:16.415
still think they get screwed a
lot of the time.

00:26:16.415 --> 00:26:18.370
&gt;&gt; Well the other.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.510
And the other thing that&#39;s
really important that Sam

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.330
pointed out it&#39;s like,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.590
the distinction now is how
much money you have, right?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.240
If you&#39;ve got the money, you
don&#39;t get screwed.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.960
You walk away with all, you
can buy your stock.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.790
You do take some risk, but you
can buy your stock.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.970
If you don&#39;t have the money,
you don&#39;t have the money.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.330
Okay.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.680
So, now, we&#39;re getting to the
person on my shirt, Toussaint.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.640
He was the best at this.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.320
And I want to take you through
some examples,

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.170
because they&#39;re very powerful.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.930
Okay so, first of all, about
Toussaint.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.860
He was born, the thing to
understand about him is he,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.300
he was born a slave.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.650
And but he wasn&#39;t just born a
slave, he was born a slave

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:57.722
in the most brutal place to be
a slave.

00:26:57.722 --> 00:27:01.930
Which was in kind of the, then
the colony of Santo Domingo,

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.970
you know, now referred to as
Haiti.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.170
But this was actually a much
more severe form of slavery,

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.050
as were, kind of,

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.880
all the sugar growing areas
than even US slavery.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.090
Which is historically a very
brutal form of slavery.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.273
And just to give you some
numbers on it, basically,

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:26.504
over the course of slavery,
the, something like 400 years,

00:27:26.504 --> 00:27:29.755
a million slaves were brought
to the US.

00:27:29.755 --> 00:27:33.159
And at the end of slavery
there were four million slaves

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:33.826
in the US.

00:27:33.826 --> 00:27:35.176
In that same period,

00:27:35.176 --> 00:27:38.330
to the sugar growing countries
in the Caribbean.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.210
2 million slaves were brought
over.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.346
And at the end of slavery,
there were 700,000 left.

00:27:43.346 --> 00:27:46.040
So from just a quantitative
perspective,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.950
like nearly ten times more
brutal.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:53.260
And I&#39;m going to read this to
you.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.020
I don&#39;t know if I quite have
time, but I don&#39;t care.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.430
&gt;&gt; So but, just to, to give
you an idea,

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.880
this isn&#39;t just like a
quantitative thing.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.043
I&#39;ll read you sort of a,

00:28:03.043 --> 00:28:07.780
a description of slavery in
Toussaint&#39;s area.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.470
Whipping was interrupted in
order to pass a piece of hot

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.360
wood on the buttocks of the
victim.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.990
Salt, pepper, citron, cinders,
aloes and

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.690
hot ashes were poured into
bleeding wounds.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.100
It&#39;s not to heal them, this is
to make it worse.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.250
Mutilations were common.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.920
Limbs, ears, and sometimes
private parts, to deprive them

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.330
of the pleasures which they
could indulge without expense.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.380
Their masters poured burning
wa, wax on their arms and

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.330
hands and shoulders.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.920
Emptied the boiling cane sugar
over their heads,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.210
burning them alive.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.970
Roasted them on slow fires,
filled them with gunpowder and

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.720
blew them up with a match.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.900
Buried them up to their necks
and

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.460
smeared their heads with
sugar,

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.655
that the flies might devour
them.

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:46.540
Fastened them to the nests of
ants or wasps.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.840
And made them eat their
excrement, drink their urine,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.970
lick saliva of other slaves.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.250
One colonist was known in
moments of anger to throw

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.330
himself onto slaves, and stick
his teeth into their flesh.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.630
So that&#39;s the slavery that he
grew up in.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.400
And it&#39;s really important to
understand this.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.880
Because to get out of that
perspective, was not easy.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.280
But he had a vision and his
vision was kind of threefold.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.023
One, he wanted to end slavery.

00:29:11.023 --> 00:29:13.102
Two, he wanted to actually
take control of

00:29:13.102 --> 00:29:14.727
the country and run the
country.

00:29:14.727 --> 00:29:17.345
And thirdly, he wanted it to
be a first class,

00:29:17.345 --> 00:29:18.631
world class country.

00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:21.504
Not just like something that,
where he had freed the slaves,

00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:24.630
but something that could
compete on a world wide basis.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.110
And so that was his mindset
going in.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.420
But that was the background
that he came from.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.150
So example, management
example,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.150
one conquering the enemy.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.610
So, the kind of sequence of
battles that

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.650
occurred in Haiti.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.472
Where first, you know, he had
to kind of defeat the locals.

00:29:40.472 --> 00:29:44.740
But then, once he defeated the
locals, which is,

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.790
there were several countries
that were very,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.850
very interested in taking
control of Haiti.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.780
Principally Spain, England and
France.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.420
So he had to defeat those
armies as well.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.650
When he conquered them, he had
to decide what

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.660
to do with the kind of
conquered soldiers, and

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.440
the leaders on the other side.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.720
And, to do this, he really
took into perspective kind of,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.060
three different points of
view.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.870
One, his soldier&#39;s point of
view.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.920
Two, the enemy&#39;s point of
view.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.930
And finally, the point of view
of the resulting culture.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.580
Like, what kind of country was
he building?

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.080
Because the army was going to
be the seed corn for

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.130
the culture of the whole
country.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.310
So from the soldier&#39;s
perspective, I get this,

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.440
you know, do we get to
pillage?

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.300
Like, soldiers like to
pillage.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.360
They get stuff, it&#39;s something
for their work.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.740
And like, the second thing is,
they&#39;re trying to kill us,

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.950
so we should kill them.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.750
Like, that&#39;s a basic
perspective of the people who

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.690
are fighting for &#39;em.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.200
So, the most important people
to, to some.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.720
Now, I put pillage up there
so, a couple things to note.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.180
One, I didn&#39;t put rape up
there.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.340
And very interestingly,

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.950
like not only did he not allow
rape among his army, but he

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.350
didn&#39;t even allow his officers
to cheat on their wives.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.980
And if they did he&#39;d get rid
of them.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.140
Because he was so concerned
about the resulting culture.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.110
What was it going to be?

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.320
Was it going to be productive?

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.200
Was it going to be best in
world?

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.100
Or was it going to be
something less than that?

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.040
And so that&#39;s, that was his
mindset going in.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.520
His army was actually famous
for not pillaging.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.060
So they were actually already
used to this,

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.990
they were famous for not
pillaging.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.800
And this was a,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.010
one of the most surprising
things to conquered people.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.214
To the point where, in Haiti
he had a reputation when even

00:31:25.214 --> 00:31:29.257
the white people were like,
very impressed with him.

00:31:29.257 --> 00:31:31.539
Just because he would go in
and go into their city and

00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:33.356
not pillage, even though he
would win.

00:31:33.356 --> 00:31:34.635
But, again,

00:31:34.635 --> 00:31:39.116
this is because he took a long
view of the culture.

00:31:39.116 --> 00:31:43.569
So, and this is a kind of
important settle point,

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:46.650
which gets him to his
conclusion.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.230
But he believed that the
culture of Haiti,

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.000
because it was a slave
culture,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.350
sugar plantation culture, was
just pretty low

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.720
grade compared to what he had
experienced in Europe.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.580
When he dealt with the
Europeans.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.460
And then he thought that slave
culture was even more

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.620
broken than Haitian culture
because if you think about

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:09.260
slave culture it&#39;s like the
kind of culture where oh, you

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.750
don&#39;t do what I tell you, I&#39;m
going to beat you to death.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.310
I&#39;m going to blow you up with
gunpowder.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:16.160
If you think the kind of
behavior that,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.500
that, then, that ensues from
that.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.580
That was the culture he knew
he needed to replace.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.090
He knew he needed to upgrade.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.550
So his solution was, when he
conquered the British or

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.340
he conquered the Spanish or he
conquered the French.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.250
He would take the very best
people from there.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.784
And he would make them
generals in his army.

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:38.940
Okay, so, you probably didn&#39;t
expect that.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.920
Like, so, here are the guys
trying to kill him.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.410
He&#39;s leading a slave
revolution.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.540
And he, when he conquers the
enemy,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.090
he actually incorporates them
into his army, and

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.670
makes him part of that.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.680
Because he wanted the
expertise, and he wanted the,

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.730
he wanted the culture to be at
a much higher level.

00:33:02.936 --> 00:33:04.470
So the second question he had.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:05.600
This is even more complicated.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
What do you do with the slave
owners?

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.970
So you&#39;re leading a slave
revolution.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.000
You take control of the
country.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.269
What do you do with the slave
owners.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.143
Three perspectives again.

00:33:19.983 --> 00:33:23.317
So for the slaves, like, come
on, like if you&#39;re a slave and

00:33:23.317 --> 00:33:25.945
you win the war against the
slave owners, like,

00:33:25.945 --> 00:33:27.360
you want to kill them.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.500
There is no question.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.460
And not only do you want to
kill them,

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.760
but like that&#39;s your land now.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.620
Like, we won.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.280
Like F you.

00:33:35.283 --> 00:33:39.160
From Toussaint&#39;s perspective,
it was more complicated

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:44.090
because he wanted Haiti to be
a first world country and

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.290
sugar was really important and

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.600
the whole slave economy was
the sugar economy.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.500
Then, right, like, on the
other hand he was a slave and

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.110
he&#39;s got to be pretty upset,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.660
particularly given the type of
slavery.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.100
Then he had, but he had to
consider like,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.300
he didn&#39;t know how to run a
sugar plantation.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.430
And then like, he didn&#39;t have
any

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.980
business relationships on who
to trade the sugar with.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.530
But on the other hand like,
like war,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.140
like you win the war you get
the land.

00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.060
Like, that&#39;s a pretty like
basic rule.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.720
So what to do?

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.340
And then if you look at the
slave owner perspective, it&#39;s

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.120
pretty interesting because
they&#39;re coming at it from the,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120
and this is the point of

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.570
view that he actually had the
discipline to understand.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.390
They were coming from a cost
structure that was

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.560
predicated on slave labor.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.910
So, like,

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.910
their business didn&#39;t work
without slave labor.

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:43.630
Like, literally if they had to
pay people, like,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.860
their cash flow wouldn&#39;t work.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.560
They paid a lot of money for
the slaves up front.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.060
And they paid a lot of money
for the land.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.220
So in their mind, like, to run
it, like, that was, like,

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.220
that&#39;s how business worked.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:55.290
Like, you can&#39;t just,

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.060
you can&#39;t just like change the
economics and

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.960
have it still work and then
they knew they had like

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.340
some power because of the
position they were in.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.380
So what was the answer for the
slave owners?

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.740
So, one, so a solution was
like,

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.090
one, I&#39;m going to end slavery,

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.610
two, I&#39;m going to let slave
owners keep their land.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:16.640
Three I&#39;m going to make them
pay their workers.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.050
So there are no more slave
labor.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.070
You have paid workers.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.117
But in order to fund that I&#39;m
going to lower their taxes.

00:35:24.087 --> 00:35:27.730
You guys ought to be kind of
impressed with that.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:29.950
Like, lower the taxes of the
slave owners after you

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.170
defeat the slave owners and,
like, end slavery.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.780
But he had a bigger goal.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:37.670
He wanted a stronger culture.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.310
The way he treated those slave
owners,

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.320
the, the need to keep the
economy going was important.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.420
And then, like, let&#39;s look at
the results.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:46.570
So, first of all, it is,

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.320
Toussaint&#39;s revolution is the
only successful slave rev,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.240
revolution in the history of
mankind.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.700
There&#39;s never been another
one.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.270
There may never, hopefully.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.270
We won&#39;t have slavery in a big
way, and

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.890
there won&#39;t be another one,
so, like, he&#39;s it.

00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:06.680
Two you know, the plantation
owners kept their land.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.660
Three, he defeated Napoleon.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.720
He had a booming economy and a
world-class culture.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.650
Under Toussaint, Haiti had
more exports,

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.460
export revenue than the United
States.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.530
So that&#39;s how successful he
was in the revolution.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.930
And this is the power of
looking at a situation not

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.330
just from your point of view,
but from the point of

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:29.210
view all the constituents,
even the people you hate.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.300
Which is hard to do when
you&#39;re CEO, and

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.190
harder to do when you&#39;re
leading a revolution.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.670
So just, look, in conclusion,
the most important thing that

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.690
you can learn as CEO, the, one
of the hardest things to

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:46.360
do is, you have to discipline
yourself to see your company

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.600
through the eyes of the people
that you&#39;re working through.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.930
Through the eyes of the
employees,

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.760
through the eyes of your
partners.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.100
Through the eyes of the people
who you&#39;re not talking to.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.520
And who are not in the room.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.106
Thank you.
Now for questions.

00:37:02.294 --> 00:37:05.029
Yes, sir?

00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.522
&gt;&gt; How do you communicate the
message to the rest of

00:37:18.522 --> 00:37:19.401
the employees?

00:37:22.956 --> 00:37:23.483
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:37:23.483 --> 00:37:24.104
Right.

00:37:24.104 --> 00:37:25.078
So this is a great question.

00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:26.268
Yes.

00:37:26.268 --> 00:37:28.660
So the question is,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.690
so if you&#39;ve gotta fire the
modern executive.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.680
One, how do you have the
conversation.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.780
And then too, like how do you
explain it to everyone else?

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.910
because like it&#39;s clearly some
kind of failure.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.700
You failed on hiring, you
failed on integrating,

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.790
they failed at their job.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.240
Like some, like it&#39;s failure.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:49.013
And so, I&#39;d say look, the
first thing is, when firing

00:37:49.013 --> 00:37:52.550
the person, you have to really
try to be honest.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.410
And you&#39;re feeling like you
failed.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.600
And I think a common reaction
is like,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.090
then there&#39;s a couple common
reactions.

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.270
One is like, you just suck.

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.710
And like, so, like, I&#39;m firing
you.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.910
**** off.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.290
That&#39;s not good because it&#39;s
not really true.

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.180
It may be like, you know,
you&#39;re failing that way.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.070
And then another kind of
common mistake is just to

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.140
be like you know, too mushy.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.460
It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.389
And it, like, feels like some
kind of weird break up

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.440
with an ex-boyfriend that you
really didn&#39;t like.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.670
But generally, like,

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:29.150
when you hire people it like,
you try to hire the best.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.420
And you hire people who are
qualified to do the job and

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.570
generally the reason that they
fail in the job

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.400
is you made some mistake in
the hiring

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.310
process and that you didn&#39;t
match them to the needs of

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.940
your company accurately
enough.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:45.810
That&#39;s the number one reason
why this fails.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:47.940
And so that&#39;s generally a good
place to start.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.410
To say, like, here&#39;s how we
are.

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.450
And here&#39;s what I didn&#39;t
recognize about us and

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.000
about you when I made the
decision.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.300
And now, like, it is what it
is.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.530
So we&#39;re going to have to move
on.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.690
And then when you talk to the
employees about it.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.740
Like, this is, and this gets
different.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.510
Which is, look, you can take
somebody&#39;s job.

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:10.590
You have to take their job.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.340
And this is something Bill
Campbell taught me.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.550
But you don&#39;t have to take
their dignity.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.400
And so it&#39;s not necessary to
get up in

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.530
front of the company, and say,
I blew that **** out.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:20.346
I capped his ****.

00:39:20.346 --> 00:39:23.430
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In fact, that&#39;s not good

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.720
because if somebody feels good
about that, like, you know,

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.770
you might feel like proud of
yourself, but

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:29.630
like nobody else feels good
about that.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.170
You know, the right thing to
do is just like thank them for

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.210
their work, like let people
know that they&#39;re moving on.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.730
And you don&#39;t really have to

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.680
explain all their personal
details.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.459
It&#39;s more important to leave
them with their dignity.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.550
And like let them go on to
live another day because look,

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.490
what you say at that meeting?

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.660
That&#39;s their reputation.

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.120
Because everybody in your
company is going to get a call

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.650
on that person when they try
and get their next job, so

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.180
if you start saying a bunch of
BS about them?

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.830
Like that&#39;s not going to be
good.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:01.020
And it&#39;s not going to get
interpreted as like,

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.640
we screwed up.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.440
It&#39;s going to get interpreted
as you know, he screwed up.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.960
And so they&#39;re kind of two
different things.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.610
You have to be very honest
with them but

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:10.310
you have to make sure you

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.842
preserve their dignity when
you talk to the company.

00:40:12.842 --> 00:40:13.953
Yes sir.

00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:17.385
&gt;&gt; So I was reading your book
yesterday and one, like,

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:20.823
I started getting heart
palpitations because it.

00:40:20.823 --> 00:40:21.607
&gt;&gt; Sorry about that.

00:40:21.607 --> 00:40:24.432
&gt;&gt; Yeah like, elsewhere.

00:40:24.432 --> 00:40:27.710
And so one question for me, I
think for everyone is

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.791
how did you in particular deal
with all the stress?

00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:36.153
Like, was it, like,
meditating, hip-hop.

00:40:36.153 --> 00:40:36.760
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What do you do?

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.965
&gt;&gt; So the question was, how
do,

00:40:38.965 --> 00:40:42.830
how do I deal with all the
stress of, being CEO.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.500
And the answer is I used to be

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.890
six foot four and good
looking.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.580
&gt;&gt; So clearly not very well.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.280
I get asked that a lot and

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.590
I, I really don&#39;t have a great
answer for it.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:00.950
I mean, I think that the one,
I

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.870
have a wonderful wife who&#39;s
sitting right here.

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:03.940
So I&#39;ll say that.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:08.230
&gt;&gt; So if you&#39;re married to
somebody, if you&#39;re married to

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.010
somebody who&#39;s supportive,
that makes it,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.410
like 1,000 times easier.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.790
If, if I did not,

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:17.033
if I wasn&#39;t, I would
definitely probably be dead,.

00:41:19.904 --> 00:41:21.030
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But, but

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:25.600
the one thing with stress is
you&#39;ve got to keep your

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.330
focus on what you can do, not
what happened to you.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.930
And that&#39;s a, it&#39;s a really
hard thing to do, because it&#39;s

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.720
constantly, and people are
always asking you about it,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.730
like, what the **** are we
going to do?

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.310
We&#39;re going to die, we&#39;re
running out of cash.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.740
It&#39;s all going to be over
soon.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.960
But you can&#39;t focus on that.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.990
You have to focus on, okay,
like what are my options?

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:44.300
What can I do?

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.310
And where can I go?

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.910
And the better you are at
that,

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.440
the kind of higher your chance
of, for success.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.410
Yes.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.858
&gt;&gt; How did Toussaint get the
French generals to work for

00:41:54.858 --> 00:41:56.311
him, like what was his pitch?

00:41:56.311 --> 00:41:58.366
&gt;&gt; Oh, so this is a great
question.

00:41:58.366 --> 00:42:00.488
How did Toussaint get the
French generals to

00:42:00.488 --> 00:42:01.183
work for him?

00:42:01.183 --> 00:42:04.630
And the reason was that they
were so.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.390
Shocked that he didn&#39;t kill
them because he was like,

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.510
they, their perspective is
we&#39;re fighting the slave army,

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.260
we&#39;re fighting the savage
army.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.330
They&#39;re going to kill us.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.800
And so when he said, like,
we&#39;re not going to kill you,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.800
that was such a shock to their
system that it

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.200
completely reoriented their
whole way of thinking.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.870
And they actually became much
more loyal to him than they

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:25.590
ever were to France.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.720
And they actually borrowed
that technique,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.040
interestingly, from Julius
Caesar who he had studied.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.230
He was a very unusual slave in
the sense that,

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:41.270
his, his owner recognized how
smart he was and put him in

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.220
the library, because he wanted
Toussainte to eventually run

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.800
the plantation for him.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.670
And so the person that he
studied most of all in

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.010
his masters&#39; library was
Julius Caesar.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.240
And so he borrowed that
technique from him.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.460
But applied in a much kind of
more dramatic context.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.750
And so, his army was kind of.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:08.250
He had British, French,
Spanish slaves.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.900
And mulattos, who, most of the
mulattos in Haiti,

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.400
at that time were pro slavery.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.510
So that was another issue, but
his leadership was so

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.350
great everybody wanted to join
him.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.130
Yes?

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.250
&gt;&gt; How do you incorporate that
same ideology into people

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.470
who were previously against
you, on your side?

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:27.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.500
You know, and it, it&#39;s,
different in different ways

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.900
but a lot of it, you know, his
whole strategy.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.720
And, and look, I&#39;m sorry the
question was, how do you, get

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.120
people, how do you incorporate
Toussainte&#39;s ideology and

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.750
get people who were previously
against you on your side.

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:48.600
And I would just say, like,
what he did, in general.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.340
Is, is the right thing, which
is to,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.450
basically you have to show
them a better way.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.930
You know as a leader, if
someone&#39;s your enemy, and

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:57.960
you need to convert them over.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.300
And this happens in business
too.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.650
Where like somebody&#39;s like a
competitor or something, and

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.540
you want to bring them over.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.390
But you want to bring them
over, you know,

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.270
you don&#39;t want to bring the,
all the unethical people

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.790
who&#39;ll switch competitor to
competitor over.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.520
And it really is, like, your
culture has to be elevated.

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.010
Your mission to be elevated.

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.660
Your way of doing things has
to be just better.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:18.860
And that was the thing that
was so

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.802
compelling, for, for the
other.

00:44:21.802 --> 00:44:22.680
Yes,.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.440
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.630
going up, your last name&#39;s
actually.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.208
It&#39;s just sort of like
introducing the bill, and

00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:31.670
it&#39;s like Have you built like
a culture around people?

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.118
You know, all the
entrepreneurs you

00:44:33.118 --> 00:44:34.847
work with that sort of
differentiated you in

00:44:34.847 --> 00:44:36.070
the market from all other VCs?

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.915
&gt;&gt; Probably not the best
question for me.

00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:39.710
I could ask Sam that.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.710
I don&#39;t know, so the question
is, you know,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.669
have we built a culture at
Andresen Oritz that is

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.310
differentiated us from all of
their VCs?

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.780
I feel like, you know, that&#39;s
certainly the goal, and,

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.470
you know, we&#39;ve been around
for five years now,

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.440
and, you know, the, the, the
attempt that we

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.780
made at it, and it&#39;s for the
rest of the world to judge if

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.470
we succeeded was basically
this, that.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.220
You know in the old days of
VC,

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.700
when I was an entrepreneur.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.220
The basic idea was like you&#39;d
have an entrepreneur and, or

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.360
an inventor, and they&#39;d get a
company to a point, and

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.360
then at that point they&#39;d
either be like ready to

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.445
be CEO, or you would go find a
CEO to replace them and

00:45:23.445 --> 00:45:24.850
build quote, unquote the
company.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.530
Our kind of cultural
philosophy was like,

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.570
the founder inventor is
special so,

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.860
we&#39;re going to design the firm
and

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.910
the culture of the firm to
help the founder develop into

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:42.100
a CEO, and so we do a lot of
systematic things different.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.990
The two biggest are one,

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:47.750
all of our partners are kind
of founders, CEOs.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:50.780
So that you get somebody, our
original motto is

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.310
some experience required, it&#39;s
a joke.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:56.490
&gt;&gt; If you were going to advise
the CEO,

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:59.130
you have to have kind of been
a CEO, imagine that.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.820
That&#39;s why I like Sam, he used
to be a CEO,

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.270
he doesn&#39;t talk about it that
much, but

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.349
he, he was a CEO and good at
it.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.040
And then the second part is
that a professional CEO would

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.840
bring in, in the old days is,
is a network of just tons of

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.090
people that he would know from
like all kinds of,

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:18.580
you know, guys who, who bought
technology at big corporations

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.230
to, like important partners in
the field.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.530
Like, guys like Google and
Facebook to, you know people

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.770
in the press that, that he or
she might know and so forth.

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.430
And so we try to basically
build that

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.078
network on your behalf, at the
firm.

00:46:33.078 --> 00:46:34.200
And we probably,

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.310
I think we do a better job of
that then anyone else.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.710
So that, those are the way
that,

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:40.220
that we try to be differen.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.140
One more question.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:41.950
&gt;&gt; Yes, one more question.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.190
Yes, the front row.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.570
&gt;&gt; Is this like, putting
yourself in others,

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.320
people&#39;s shoes is very
important in management.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.220
So, can you give us some tips
to do it?

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:55.916
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.

00:46:55.916 --> 00:46:57.200
&gt;&gt; How can you.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, so,

00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.980
putting yourself in other
people&#39;s shoes is,

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.090
is difficult in management.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.970
Can you think about how to do
it in daily life?

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:03.670
It&#39;s hard.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:04.600
It&#39;s hard in daily life.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.170
It&#39;s even harder in
management.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:08.400
Because it&#39;s a stress of the
moment, right?

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.210
Like, a great employee is
asking you for

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.970
a raise, it is very hard not
to respond.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:13.810
It&#39;s, it&#39;s a very,

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:15.470
because like you do not
want to lose them, and

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.480
like they&#39;re not asking you
for a raise randomly.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.950
They&#39;re asking you a raise for
a reason.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.870
And so to say okay, you know,
particularly if you don&#39;t have

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.290
a process in place to go stop,
like back out.

00:47:27.573 --> 00:47:33.698
I would just say that, and
it&#39;s a key thing in being,

00:47:33.698 --> 00:47:38.214
a leader is you&#39;ve got to
pause yourself.

00:47:38.214 --> 00:47:39.306
Like if somebody comes to

00:47:39.306 --> 00:47:42.120
you with something that you
know is important.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.640
But you want to feel like, you
know, when you&#39;re a leader you

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.080
want to feel like you have all
the answers.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.840
Like right now you guys are
asking me questions,

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.840
if I don&#39;t know the answer
I&#39;ll make something up.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.230
Because I want you to think
I&#39;m real smart.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:56.750
and, and it&#39;s important, I,

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:59.030
I&#39;d say the most important
thing is to pause.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:00.890
Like so if you know something
is really important and

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:02.390
you haven&#39;t thought it
through.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.920
Says to say,

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.460
you know, look, I&#39;m taking
this really seriously but

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.530
I have to pause because I have
to think it through from all

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.230
perspectives and I&#39;m going to
come back, and, and

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.450
I end up doing that a lot just
because there are a lot of

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.210
things that you run into that
you haven&#39;t seen before, and

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.780
I&#39;ll tell you, you, you know,

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.590
most CEOs, including myself,
learn this the hard way.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:27.390
You walk in you kind of step
in it like three or

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:28.020
four times.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.420
You go okay, I&#39;m going to
sneak away with this.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.160
Nobody&#39;s going to see me give
them the raise.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.860
I&#39;m going to do it and

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.900
it&#39;s going to be all under the
covers, confidentiality baby.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.810
And then like it comes up and

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.570
it blows up in your face three
weeks later.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.730
And you&#39;re like, oh my God,
what have I done, or

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.368
three months later, or even a
year later.

00:48:44.368 --> 00:48:47.580
And then, you know,

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.820
once, it&#39;s a year later, it&#39;s
a huge problem.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.370
Like so you&#39;ve taken what&#39;s a
little emotional problem and

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.360
you&#39;ve turned it into a forest
fire.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.210
You know we call it the kimchi
problem.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:02.600
The deeper you bury it the
hotter it gets.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.180
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a Korean joke.

00:49:06.855 --> 00:49:10.400
But but, you know, it takes
practice.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.780
I would say it takes practice.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.350
And it&#39;s very difficult to do.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.120
And I would say, you know,

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:17.650
like, some of the, my friend,
Bill Campbell.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.970
This is his big skill.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.280
Like, this is what he&#39;s so
great at.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.650
People always try and describe
him to me.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.880
And I&#39;m like, that&#39;s not him
at all.

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:24.970
That&#39;s not what he&#39;s good at.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:26.550
Like, he&#39;s not good at that or
that.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:27.290
He&#39;s good at this.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.520
He&#39;s good at seeing the
company through the eyes of

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.690
the employees.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.790
And, it&#39;s, like I said, if
you, if you&#39;re good at that,

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.770
you&#39;ll be in a, very likely in
an elite, leader.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:39.180
So thank you, thank you.

1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,240
Welcome.

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:04,217
Can I turn this on?

3
00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:07,381
Maybe, all right.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,090
>> Can people hear in the
back?

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,660
>> Can you guys hear me?

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,678
Is the mic on?

7
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:18,038
No, ah, maybe you can ask
them to turn it on.

8
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:19,490
Maybe we can get a bigger,
ah, there we go.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,657
All right.

10
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,618
Maybe we can get a bigger
auditorium, we'll see.

11
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:25,270
So welcome to CS183B.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:25,950
I'm Sam Altman.

13
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm the President of Y
Combinator.

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,780
Nine years ago, I was a
Stanford student and

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,630
then I dropped out to start
a company.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,990
And then I've been an
investor for the last few.

17
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,140
So, at YC, we've been
teaching people how to

18
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,440
start startups for nine
years.

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,930
Most of it's very hands on
and

20
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,875
specific to the startups.

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,180
But, 30% of it is pretty
generally applicable.

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,340
And so, we think that we

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,210
can teach that 30% in this
class.

24
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,890
And even though that's only
30% of the way

25
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,600
there hopefully it'll still
be really helpful.

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,750
We've taught a lot of this
at YC already, but

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,520
it's all been off the
record.

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,440
And this is the first time
that a lot of what we

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,370
teach in YC is gonna be on
the record.

30
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,360
So we've invited some of our
best speakers to come and

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,809
give the same talks they
give at YC.

32
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,960
We've now funded 720
companies.

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,620
And so, we're pretty sure

34
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,460
that a lot of this advice is
pretty good.

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,000
We can't fund every startup
yet, but we can

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,710
hopefully make this advice
very generally available.

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,300
Guest speakers are gonna
teach 17 of the 20 classes.

38
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,010
I'm only teaching three.

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
Counting YC itself,

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,820
every guest speaker has been
involved in the creation of

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,840
a billion plus dollar
company.

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,110
So the advice shouldn't be
that theoretical.

43
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,680
It's all been, it's all from
people who have done it.

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,270
All of the advice in

45
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,340
this class is geared towards
people starting a business

46
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,360
where the goal was
hyper-growth.

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,700
And eventually building a
very large company.

48
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,360
Much of it doesn't apply in
other cases and

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,950
I wanna warn people up
front.

50
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,610
That if you try and

51
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,730
do these things in a lot of
big companies or

52
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,640
non startups, it won't work.

53
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,130
It should still be
interesting.

54
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,720
I, I really do think that
startups are the way of

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,060
the future and it's worth
trying to understand them.

56
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,470
But startups are very
different

57
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,300
than normal companies.

58
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,040
So over the course of today
and

59
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,660
Thursday, I'm gonna try to
give an overview of the four

60
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,580
areas that you need to excel
at in order to

61
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,930
maximize your chances of
success at a startup.

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,490
And then throughout the
course, the guest speakers

63
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,750
are gonna drill into all of
these in more detail.

64
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,480
So the four areas, you need
a great idea,

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,660
a great product, a great
team and great execution.

66
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,650
These overlap somewhat, but
I'm gonna have to talk about

67
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,130
them somewhat individually
to make it make sense.

68
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,600
You may still fail.

69
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,230
The outcome is something
like idea times product

70
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,300
times execution times team
times luck,

71
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,010
where luck is the random
number between 0 and 10,000.

72
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,300
Literally that much.

73
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,500
But if you do really well in
the four areas you can

74
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,205
control, you have a good
chance of at

75
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:40,637
least some amount of
success.

76
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,771
One of the exciting things
about startups, is

77
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,590
that they are surprisingly
even playing field.

78
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,290
Young and inexperienced, you
can do this.

79
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,500
Old and very experienced,
you can do this too.

80
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,885
And one of the things that I
particularly like about

81
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:55,700
startups is that some of the
things that are bad in

82
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,720
other work situations, like
being poor and unknown are

83
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,875
actually huge assets when it
comes to starting a startup.

84
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,340
Before we jump in on the
how.

85
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,850
I want to talk about why you
should start a startup.

86
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm somewhat hesitant to be
doing this class at all,

87
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,110
because you should never
start a startup just for

88
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,520
the sake of doing so.

89
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,530
There are much easier ways
to get rich and

90
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,220
everyone who starts a
startup always says,

91
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,610
always, that they couldn't
have imagined how hard and

92
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,360
painful it was going to be.

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,330
You should only start a
startup if you com,

94
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,860
feel compelled by a
particular problem.

95
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,410
And that you think starting
a company is

96
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,120
the best way to solve it.

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,090
The specific passion should
come first and

98
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,510
the startup second.

99
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,240
In fact, all of

100
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,340
the big successes we have at
YC followed this.

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,510
So, for the second half of
today's lecture,

102
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,705
Dustin Moskovitz the
co-founder of Facebook and

103
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,330
Asana, is going to take over
and

104
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,420
talk about why to start a
startup.

105
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,564
We're so surprised by the
amount of

106
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,228
attention that this class
got.

107
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:45,930
That we wanna make sure we

108
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,890
spend a lot of time on the
why.

109
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,150
Okay.
So

110
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,190
the first of the four areas.

111
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,770
A great idea.

112
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,980
It's become popular in

113
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,640
recent years to say that the
idea doesn't matter.

114
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,310
In fact, it's almost uncool
to spend a lot of time

115
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,010
thinking about the idea for
a startup.

116
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,540
You're just supposed to
start.

117
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,280
Throw stuff at the walls.

118
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,770
See what sticks.

119
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,400
And not even spend any time
thinking about if

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
it'll be valuable if it
works.

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,810
And pivots are supposed to
be great.

122
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,580
The more pivots, the better.

123
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,380
So this isn't totally wrong.

124
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,240
Things do evolve in

125
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,930
ways that are difficult to
predict.

126
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,850
And there's a limit to how
much you can figure out,

127
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,980
without actually getting a
product in

128
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,760
the hands of users.

129
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,400
And great execution is at

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,170
least ten times more
important and

131
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,490
a hundred times harder than
a good idea.

132
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,270
But the pendulum has swung
way out of whack here.

133
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,990
A bad idea is still bad.

134
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,510
In the pivot happy world
that we're in today,

135
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,660
it feels really sub optimal.

136
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
Great execution towards a
terrible idea

137
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,340
will get you nowhere.

138
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,360
There are exceptions, of
course.

139
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,640
But most great companies
start with

140
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,470
a great idea, not a pivot.

141
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,130
If you look at successful
pivots, they almost always

142
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,690
are a pivot into something
the founders

143
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,810
themselves wanted, not a
random made up idea.

144
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,060
Airbnb happened because
Brian Chesky couldn't pay

145
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,990
his rent, but he did have
some extra space.

146
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,800
In general, though,

147
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,860
if you look at the track
record of pivots,

148
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,910
they don't become big
companies.

149
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,970
I myself used to believe
ideas didn't matter that

150
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,490
much, but I'm very sure
that's wrong now.

151
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,180
The definition of the idea,

152
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,610
as we talk about it, is very
broad.

153
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,930
It includes the size and the
growth of the market,

154
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,520
the growth strategy for the
company,

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,838
the defensibility strategy
and so on.

156
00:05:17,838 --> 00:05:18,810
When you're evaluating an
idea,

157
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,710
you need to think through
all these things,

158
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,450
not just the product.

159
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,500
If it works out, you're
gonna be working on this for

160
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,630
ten years.

161
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,620
So it's worth some real
upfront time

162
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,910
to think we've a long term
value in

163
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,170
the defensibility of the
business.

164
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,770
Even though plans themselves
are worthless,

165
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,410
to exercise a planning is
really valuable and

166
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,810
totally missing in most
startups today.

167
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,170
Long term thinking is so
where,

168
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,612
anywhere, but especially in
startups.

169
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:44,900
That it's a huge advantage
if you do it.

170
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,570
Remember that the idea will
expand and

171
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,620
become more ambitious as you
go.

172
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,620
You certainly don't need to
have everything figured out,

173
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,630
in a path from here to world
domination.

174
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,360
But you really want a nice
kernel to start with.

175
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,930
>> You want something that
can develop in

176
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,630
interesting ways.

177
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,340
As you're thinking through
ideas,

178
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,830
another thing that we see
young founders get

179
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,560
wrong all the time, is that
someday you need to

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,860
build a business that's
difficult to replicate.

181
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,160
This is an important part of
a good idea.

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,536
I wanna make this point
again because it's

183
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,040
so important.

184
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,200
The idea should come first,
and

185
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,820
the startup should come
second.

186
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,350
Wait to start a startup,
until you come up

187
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,150
with an idea you feel
compelled to explore.

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,940
This is also the way to

189
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,980
chose between multiple
ideas.

190
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,745
If you have several ideas
that all seem pretty good,

191
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,800
work on the one that you
think about most often when

192
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,820
you're not trying to think
about work.

193
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,940
But we hear again and again
from founders that they

194
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,070
wish they had waited to
start a startup until they

195
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,460
came up with an idea that
they really loved.

196
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,000
Another way of looking at
this is that the best

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,550
companies are almost always
mission oriented.

198
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,400
It's difficult to get large
groups of people to

199
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,550
the extreme levels of focus
and productivity that you

200
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,230
need for a startup to be
successful,

201
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,660
unless the company feels
like an important mission.

202
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,620
And it's usually really hard
to get that without a great

203
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,220
founding idea.

204
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,000
A related advantage of
mission oriented

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,550
ideas is that you yourself
will be dedicated to them.

206
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,620
It takes years and

207
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
years, usually a decade to
create a great startup.

208
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,170
If you don't love and

209
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,660
believe in what you're
building,

210
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,340
you're likely to give up at
some point along the way.

211
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,430
There's no way I know of to
get through the pain of a

212
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,680
startup without belief that
the mission really matters.

213
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,500
A lot of founders,
especially students,

214
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,332
believe that their startup's
only gonna take two or

215
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,690
three years and then after
that they'll work on

216
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,310
what they're really
passionate about.

217
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,480
That almost never works.

218
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
Good startups usually take
ten years.

219
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,710
A third advantage of
mission-oriented

220
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,350
companies is that people
outside the company,

221
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,880
are more willing to help
you.

222
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,740
You'll get more support on

223
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,700
a hard important project
than a derivative one.

224
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,820
When it comes to starting
startups,

225
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,830
in many ways it's easier to

226
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,050
start a hard startup than an
easy startup.

227
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,580
This is one of those
counter-intuitive things.

228
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,860
It takes people a long time
to understand.

229
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,710
It's difficult to overstate
how

230
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,270
important being
mission-driven is, so

231
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,230
I wanna emphasize it one
last time.

232
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,240
Derivative companies,
companies that

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,180
copy an existing idea with
very few new insights,

234
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,240
don't excite people and they
don't compel the teams to

235
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,940
work hard enough to be
successful.

236
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,790
Paul Graham is gonna talk
about how to

237
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,870
get startup ideas next week.

238
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,740
It's something that a lot of
founders struggle with but

239
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,850
it's something I believe you
can get better with it,

240
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,040
better at with practice.

241
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,530
And it's definitely worth
trying to get better at.

242
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,590
The hardest part about
coming up

243
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,950
with great ideas is that

244
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,010
the best ideas often look
terrible at the beginning.

245
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,350
The 13th search engine and

246
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,180
without all the features of
web portal.

247
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,930
Most people thought that was
pointless, search was done,

248
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,500
and anyway, it didn't matter
that much,

249
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,440
Portal's where the value is
at.

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,870
The tenth social network,
and

251
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,582
limited only to college
students with no money?

252
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,770
Also terrible.

253
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,670
MySpace had won, and

254
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,730
who wants college students
as customers, or

255
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,450
a way to stay on strangers'
couches?

256
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,640
That just sounds terrible
all around.

257
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
These all sounded really
bad,

258
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,870
but they turned out to be
good.

259
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,180
If they had sounded really
good,

260
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,100
there would have been too
many people working on them.

261
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,620
As Peter Tills discussed in
the fifth class,

262
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,020
you want an idea that turns
into a monopoly, but

263
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,040
you can't get a monopoly in
a big market right away.

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,960
Too much competition for
that.

265
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,580
You have to find a small
market in which you can get

266
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,211
a monopoly, and then quickly
expand.

267
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,380
This is why some great
startup ideas look

268
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,330
really bad at the beginning.

269
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,720
It's good if you can say
something like, today only

270
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,130
the small subset of users
are going to use my product.

271
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,710
But I'm gonna get all of
them.

272
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,383
And in the future,

273
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,740
almost everyone will use my
product.

274
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,720
>> Here's the thing that's
gonna come up a lot,

275
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,230
you need conviction in your
own beliefs, and

276
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,810
the willingness to ignore
others nay saying.

277
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,440
The hard part is that this
is a very fine line.

278
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,910
There's right on one side of
it, and crazy on the other.

279
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,240
But keep in mind that if you
do come up with

280
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,300
a great idea, most people
are going to think it's bad.

281
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,980
You should be happy about
that.

282
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,460
It means they won't compete
with you.

283
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,800
This is also a reason why
it's

284
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,750
not usually dangerous to
tell people about your idea.

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,520
The truly good ideas don't
sound like

286
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,190
they're worth stealing.

287
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,640
You want an idea about which
you can say,

288
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,500
I know it sounds like a bad
idea.

289
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,240
But hear specifically why
it's actually a great one.

290
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,180
You wanna sound crazy, but
you wanna actually be right.

291
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,280
And you want an idea that
not many

292
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,060
other people are working on.

293
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,470
And it's okay if it doesn't
sound big at first.

294
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,800
Common mistake among
founders,

295
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,380
especially first time
founders,

296
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,830
is they think that the first
version of their product,

297
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,440
the first version of their
idea,

298
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,910
needs to sound really big.

299
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,440
But it doesn't.

300
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
It needs to take over a
small,

301
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,460
specific market and expand
from there.

302
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,880
That's how most great
companies have started.

303
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,580
Unpopular but right is what
you're going for.

304
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,210
You want something that
sounds like a bad idea, but

305
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,840
is a good idea.

306
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,870
You also really wanna take
the time to

307
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,350
think about how the market's
going to evolve.

308
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,620
You need a market that's
going to be big in

309
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,320
ten years.

310
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,729
Most investors are obsessed
with the market size today,

311
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,834
and they don't think at all
about how the market is

312
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:41,190
going to evolve.

313
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,560
In fact, I think this is one
of the biggest

314
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,010
systemic mistakes that
investors make.

315
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,250
They think about the growth
of the startup itself,

316
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,640
they don't think about the
growth of the market.

317
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,370
I care much more about the
growth rate of

318
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,050
the market than it's current
size.

319
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,720
And I also care if

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,010
there's any reason that it's
gonna top out.

321
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,350
You should think about this.

322
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,150
I'd prefer to invest in

323
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,850
a company that's going after
a small but

324
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,410
rapidly growing market than
a big but slow growing one.

325
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,660
One of the big advantages of
these sorts of markets um,

326
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,930
these small but rapidly
growing markets, is that

327
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,640
customers are usually pretty
desperate for a solution.

328
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,358
And they'll put, put up with
an imperfect but

329
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:13,470
rapidly improving product.

330
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,980
And a big advantage of being
a student, one of

331
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,780
the two biggest advantages
is that you probably have

332
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,170
better intuition about which
markets are likely to

333
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,660
start growing rapidly than
older people do.

334
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,640
Another thing that students
usually don't understand, or

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,630
at least takes a while you
cannot create a market that

336
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,120
doesn't want to exist.

337
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,370
You can basically change
everything in

338
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,180
a startup but the market.

339
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,760
So you should actually do
some thinking, to be sure or

340
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,810
at least as sure as you can
be, that the market your

341
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,460
going after is going to grow
and be there.

342
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,460
There are a lot of different
ways to

343
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,040
talk about the right kind of
market.

344
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,980
For example, surfing someone
else's wave or

345
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,420
stepping into an up elevator
or being part of a movement.

346
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,110
But all of this is just a
way of saying you want

347
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,200
a market that's going to
grow really quickly.

348
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,100
It may seem small today.

349
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,340
It may be small today.

350
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,040
But you know, and

351
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,900
other people don't that it's
gonna grow really fast.

352
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,660
So think about where this is
happening in the world.

353
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,240
You need this sort of

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,880
a tail wind to make a
startup successful.

355
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
The exciting thing is there
are probably more of

356
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,010
these tail winds now than
ever before.

357
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,841
As Mark Andreessen says,

358
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,810
software is eating the
world.

359
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,810
It's just everywhere.

360
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,190
There are like, so many
great ideas out there and

361
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,130
you just have to pick one,
and

362
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,220
find one that you really
care about.

363
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,877
Another version of this,

364
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,585
that would, gets down to the
same idea,

365
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:25,570
is Sequoia's famous
question.

366
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,870
Why now?

367
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,510
Why is this the perfect time
for this particular idea and

368
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,310
to start this particular
company?

369
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,140
Why couldn't it have been
done two years ago?

370
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,500
And why will two years in
the future be too late?

371
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,165
For the most successful
startups we've been

372
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,915
involved with, they've all
had a great idea,

373
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:41,110
great answer to this
question.

374
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,030
And if you don't, you should
be at

375
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,170
least somewhat suspicious
about it.

376
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,530
In general, it's best if

377
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,940
you're building something
that you yourself need.

378
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,180
You'll understand it much
better than if you have to

379
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,040
understand it by talking to

380
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,650
a customer to build the very
first version.

381
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,440
If you don't know it
yourself and

382
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,610
you're building something
that someone else needs,

383
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,670
realize that you're at a big
disadvantage and get very,

384
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,200
very close to your
customers.

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,510
Try to work in their office
if you can.

386
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,458
And if not, talk to them
multiple times a day.

387
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:09,910
Another somewhat
counter-intuitive thing

388
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,220
about good start up ideas,

389
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,720
is that they're almost
always very easy to explain,

390
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,400
and very easy to understand.

391
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,660
If it takes more than a
sentence to

392
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,210
explain what you're doing
um,

393
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,170
it's almost always a sign
that it's too complicated.

394
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,860
It should be a clearly
articulate,

395
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,800
articulated vision with a
small number of words.

396
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,020
And the best ideas are
usually either,

397
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,460
very different from existing
companies in one

398
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,800
important way.

399
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,620
Like Google being a search
engine that worked

400
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,540
just really well and none of
the other stuff of

401
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,750
the portals or totally new,
like Space X.

402
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,080
Any company that's a clone
of

403
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
something else that already
exists with some small or

404
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,310
made up differentiator,

405
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,280
like we're gonna be x
beautiful design or

406
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,340
we're gonna be y for people
that like red wine instead.

407
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,170
That usually fails.

408
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,890
So as I mentioned one of the
great things about being

409
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,820
a student is you

410
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,520
have a very good perspective
on new technology.

411
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,110
And learning to get good at
having new

412
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,750
ideas takes a while.

413
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,930
So start working on that
right now.

414
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,550
That's one thing we hear
from people all the time,

415
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,550
that they wish they had

416
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,530
done more when they were a
student.

417
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,514
The other is meeting
potential co-founders.

418
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,170
You have no idea how good of
an environment you are in

419
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,210
right now for meeting people
that you

420
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,110
can start a company with
down the road.

421
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,860
And the one thing that we

422
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,680
always tell college
students, is more

423
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,150
important than starting any
particular startup

424
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,870
is getting to know a lot of
potential co-founders.

425
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,400
So I want to finish this
section of my talk

426
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,820
with a quote from 50 Cent.

427
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,190
This is from when he was
asked about vitamin water.

428
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,050
I won't read it, its up
there.

429
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,600
But it's about the
importance of

430
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,730
thinking about what
customers want, and

431
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,050
thinking about the demands
of the market.

432
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,470
Most people don't do this,

433
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,090
most students especially
don't do this.

434
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,410
If you can just do this one
thing, if you can just

435
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:52,990
learn to think about the
market first, you will have

436
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,430
a big leg up on most people
starting startups.

437
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,040
All right, and this is
something.

438
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,060
This is probably the thing
that we

439
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,390
see wrong with Y Combinator
apps most frequently, is

440
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,090
that people have not thought
about the market first.

441
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,040
And what people want first.

442
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,570
So for the next section,

443
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm gonna talk about
building a great product.

444
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:12,568
And here again,

445
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm gonna use a very broad
definition of product.

446
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,242
It includes customer support
and

447
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:21,280
copyright explaining the
product.

448
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,220
Anything involved in your
customer's interaction with

449
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,880
what you built for them.

450
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,890
To build a really great
company, you first have to

451
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,080
turn a great idea into a
great product.

452
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,260
This is really hard, but
it's crucially important,

453
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,250
and fortunately it's pretty
fun.

454
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,760
Although great products are
always new to the world and

455
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,290
it's hard to give you advice
about what to build,

456
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,010
there are enough
commonalities that we

457
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,000
can give you a lot of advice
about how to build it.

458
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,680
One of the most important
tasks for a founder is to

459
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,140
make sure that the company
builds a great product.

460
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,740
Until you've built a great
product,

461
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,540
almost nothing else matters.

462
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,100
When really successful
startup founders tell

463
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,890
the story of their early
days.

464
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,350
It's almost always sitting
in front of the computer,

465
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,080
working on their product or
talking to their customers.

466
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,270
That's pretty much all the
time.

467
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,930
They do very little else,
and

468
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,640
you should be very skeptical
if your time allocation is

469
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,140
much different.

470
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,880
Most other problems that
founders are trying to

471
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,070
solve, raising money,
getting more press,

472
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,060
hiring, business
development, et cetera.

473
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,260
These are significantly
easier when you

474
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,819
have a great product.

475
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,970
It's really important to
take care of that first.

476
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,760
Step 1, is to build
something that users love.

477
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,380
At YC, we tell founders to
work on their product,

478
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,230
talk to users, exercise eat
and

479
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,360
sleep and very little else.

480
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,990
All the other stuff I just
mentioned, PR conferences,

481
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
recruiting advisers, doing
partnerships,

482
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,810
you should ignore all of
that and

483
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,990
just build a product.

484
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,160
And get it as good as
possible by

485
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,020
talking to your users.

486
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,870
Your job is to build
something that users love.

487
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,150
Very few companies that go
on to be

488
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,320
super successful get there
without first doing this.

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,590
A lot of good on paper
startups fail because they

490
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,830
merely make something that
people like.

491
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,115
Making something that people
want,

492
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,450
but only a medium amount is
a great way to fail and

493
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,300
not understand why you're
failing.

494
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,270
So these are the two jobs.

495
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,770
Something that we say at

496
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,080
YC a lot is that it's better
to build a small number,

497
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,950
it's better to build
something that a small

498
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,510
number of users love than a
large number of users like.

499
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,570
Of course, it'd be best to

500
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,840
build something that a small
number of users love.

501
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,570
But opportunities to do that
for V1 are rare, and

502
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,190
they're usually not
available to startups.

503
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,020
So in practice,

504
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,140
you end up choosing either
the grey or the orange.

505
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,380
You make something that a
lot of users like a little

506
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,570
bit, or something that a
small number of users,

507
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,520
like, love a lot.

508
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,040
And this is a very important
piece of advice.

509
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
Build something that a small
number of users love.

510
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,450
It's much easier to expand
from something that

511
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,100
a small number of

512
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,710
people love to something
that a lot of people love.

513
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,660
Than from something that a
lot of

514
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,220
people like to a lot of
people love.

515
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,410
If you get this right,

516
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,920
you can get a lot of other
things wrong.

517
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,730
If you don't get this right,

518
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,700
you can get everything else
right,

519
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,910
and you'll probably still
fail.

520
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,500
So when you start on a
startup, this is the only

521
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,410
thing you need to care about
until it's working.

522
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,640
>> Excuse me, can you
explain that again?

523
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,190
>> Sure.
So you have

524
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,410
a choice in a startup.

525
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,080
The best thing of all worlds
would be to

526
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,650
build a product that a lot
of people will really love.

527
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,290
In practice you

528
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,240
can't usually do that
because of big company.

529
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,810
If there's an opportunity
like that, Google or

530
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,250
Facebook will do it.

531
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,070
So there's like a limit to
the area under the curve

532
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,860
of what you can build and
you can either build

533
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,160
something that lot of users
like a little bit or you can

534
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,980
build something that a small
number of users love a lot.

535
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,280
And, like, the total amount
of love is the same,

536
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,800
it's just a question of how
it's distributed.

537
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,610
And there's like this law of
conversation of

538
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,140
how much happiness you can
put into the world

539
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,160
with the first product of a
startup.

540
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,356
And so startups always
struggle with which of

541
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:39,640
those two they should go.

542
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,680
And they seem equal,

543
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,260
right, cuz the area under
the curve is the same.

544
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,480
But we've seen this time and
again that they're not.

545
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,120
And that it's so much easier
to expand.

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,330
Once you've got something
that some people love,

547
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:49,970
you can expand that

548
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,910
something that a lot of
other people love.

549
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,000
But if you only get
ambivalence or

550
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,860
sort of like weak
enthusiasm.

551
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,200
And then try to expand that,

552
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,820
you'll never get up to a lot
of people loving it.

553
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,340
So the advice is, uh, find a
small group of users and

554
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,660
make them really love what
you're doing.

555
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,230
Does that make sense?

556
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,800
All right.

557
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,220
I'm, I'm, one way that you
know when this is

558
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,610
working is that you'll get
growth by word of mouth.

559
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,850
If you make something people
love

560
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,170
people will tell their
friends about it.

561
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,490
This works for consumer
products and

562
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:23,470
enterprise products, as
well.

563
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,780
When people really love
something,

564
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,000
they tell their friends
about it and

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,870
you'll see organic growth.

566
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,110
If you find yourself talking
about how it's okay that

567
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,400
you're not growing because
there's a big partnership

568
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,320
that's gonna come save you
or something like that,

569
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,820
it's almost always a sign of
real trouble.

570
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,230
Sales and marketing are
really important, and

571
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,260
we're gonna have two classes
on them later.

572
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,580
But if you don't have some
early organic growth,

573
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,170
then your product probably
isn't good enough yet.

574
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,616
A great product is the
secret to

575
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:48,786
long term growth hacking.

576
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:49,454
You should get

577
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,681
that right before you worry
about anything else.

578
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,259
It doesn't get easier to put
off making a great product.

579
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,040
If you try to build a growth
machine before you

580
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,910
have a product that some
people really love,

581
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,660
you're almost certainly
gonna waste your time.

582
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,670
Breakout companies almost
always have a product

583
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,190
that's so good that it grows
by word of mouth.

584
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,900
Over the long run great
products win.

585
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,110
Don't worry about your
competitors raising a lot of

586
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,750
money and what they may do
in the future.

587
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,270
They probably aren't very
good anyway.

588
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,840
Very few startups die from
competition.

589
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,530
Most die because they
themselves fail to

590
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,770
make something users love.

591
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,930
They spend their time on
other things.

592
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,520
So worry about this above
all else.

593
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,160
Another piece of advice to
make something that

594
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,530
users love is to start with
something simple.

595
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,830
It's much, much easier to
make a great product if

596
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,260
you have something simple.

597
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,050
Even if your eventual plans
are super complex, and

598
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,560
hopefully they are,

599
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,280
you can almost always start
with a smaller subset of

600
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,580
the problem than whatever
you think is the smallest.

601
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,980
And it's hard to build a
great product.

602
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,750
So you wanna start with as

603
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,850
little surface area as
possible.

604
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,490
Think about the really
successful companies and

605
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,920
what they started with.

606
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,650
Think about products that
you really love.

607
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,480
They're generally incredibly
simple to use and

608
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,700
especially to get started
using.

609
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,710
The first version of

610
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,030
Facebook was almost
comically simple.

611
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,540
The first version of Google
was just an ugly

612
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,950
webpage with a textbox and
two buttons but it returned

613
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,270
the best results, and that's
why users loved it.

614
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,520
The iPhone is far simpler to

615
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,630
use than any smartphone that
ever came before it and

616
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,080
it was the first one that
people really loved.

617
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,630
Another reason that simple
is good,

618
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,540
is because it forces you to
do one thing extremely well.

619
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,160
And you have to do that to
make

620
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,603
something that people love.

621
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:21,567
The word fanatical comes up
again and

622
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:25,582
again when you listen to
successful founders talk

623
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:29,033
about how they think about
their product.

624
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,770
Founders talk about being
fanatical in the way

625
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,180
they care about the quality
of the small details.

626
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,900
Fanatical in getting the
copy that they use to

627
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,370
explain the product just
right and fanatical in

628
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,670
the way they think about
customer support.

629
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,290
In fact, one thing that
correlates into

630
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,920
success among the YC
companies is the founders

631
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,340
that hook up pager duty to
their ticketing system, so

632
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,610
that even if the user emails
in the middle of

633
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,160
the night when the founders
are asleep.

634
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,370
They still get a response
within an hour.

635
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,390
Companies actually do this
in the early days.

636
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,500
These founders feel physical
pain when the product sucks.

637
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,010
And they wanna wake up and
fix it.

638
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,030
They don't ship crap.

639
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,690
And if they do they fix it
very, very quickly.

640
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,350
And it definitely takes some
level of

641
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,210
fanaticism to build a great
product.

642
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,280
You need some users to help
with the feedback cycle.

643
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,990
But the way to get those
users is manually.

644
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,190
You should go recruit them
by hand.

645
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,860
Don't do things like buy
Google ads in

646
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,100
the early days to get
initial users.

647
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,420
You don't need very many.

648
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,090
You just needs ones that
will give you feedback every

649
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,390
day and eventually love your
product.

650
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,470
So instead of trying to get
them on Google AdWords,

651
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,510
just find a few people in
the world that will be

652
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,270
good users.

653
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,970
Recruit them by hand.

654
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,880
Ben Silverman when everyone
though Pinterest was a joke,

655
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,385
recruited the initial
Pinterest users by

656
00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:36,550
tagging up strangers in
coffee shops.

657
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,590
He really did.
He just walked around

658
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,300
Palo Alto and said will you
please use my product.

659
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,820
He also used to run around
the Apple store in

660
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,730
Palo Alto.

661
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,941
And he would like set all
the browsers to

662
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,706
the Pinterest home page real
quick before they caught him

663
00:22:45,706 --> 00:22:46,340
and kicked him out.

664
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,990
So then when people walked
in there, they were like oh,

665
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,900
what is this?

666
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,650
This is an important example
of doing things

667
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,170
that don't scale.

668
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,460
If you haven't read Paul
Graham's essay on

669
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,030
that topic you definitely
should.

670
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,490
So get users manually and
remember that the goal is to

671
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,610
get a small group of them to
love you.

672
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,630
Understand that group
extremely well,

673
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,060
get extremely close into
them, close to them,

674
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,160
listen to them and you'll
almost always find out

675
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,610
that they're very willing to
give you feedback.

676
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,660
Even if you're building the
product for

677
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,090
yourself, listen to outside
users and

678
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,560
they'll tell you how to make
a product they'll pay for.

679
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,955
Do whatever you need to make
them love you,

680
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,690
make you're doing, cuz
they're also gonna be

681
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,440
the advocates that help you
get your next users.

682
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,260
You wanna build an engine in
the company that transforms

683
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,810
feedback from users into
product decisions then get

684
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,460
it back in front of the
users and then repeat.

685
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,124
Ask them what they like and

686
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,200
what they don't like, and
watch them use it.

687
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,020
Ask them what they pay for.

688
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,490
Ask them if they'd be really
bummed if

689
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,190
your company went away.

690
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,160
Ask them what would make
them recommend the product

691
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,190
to their friends.

692
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,260
And ask them if they've
recommended it to any yet.

693
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,980
You should make this
feedback loop as

694
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,330
tight as possible.

695
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,480
If your product gets 10%
better every week,

696
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,700
that compounds really,
really quickly.

697
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,760
One of the great advantages
of start,

698
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,930
of software startups is just
how short you

699
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,330
can make the feedback loop.

700
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,888
It can go circle in hours,
and the best

701
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,930
companies usually have the
tightest feedback loops.

702
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,120
You should try to keep this
going for

703
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,650
all of your company's life.

704
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,190
But it's really important in
the early days.

705
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,630
The good news is that all of
this is doable.

706
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,070
It's hard, it takes a lot of
effort, but

707
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,220
there's no magic.

708
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,460
The plan is at least
straight forward and

709
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,960
you will eventually get to a
great product.

710
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,510
Great founders don't put

711
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,740
anyone between themselves
and their users.

712
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,330
The founders of

713
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,830
these companies do things
like sales and

714
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,020
customer support themselves
in the early days.

715
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,650
It's critical to

716
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,440
get this loop embedded in
the culture.

717
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,850
In fact, the specific
problem that we

718
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,110
always see with Stanford
startups for

719
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,890
some reason is that the
students try and

720
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,880
hire sales and customer
support people right away.

721
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,280
And you've gotta do this
yourself.

722
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:37,910
It's the only way.

723
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,200
You really need to use
metrics to

724
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,340
keep yourself honest on
this.

725
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,560
It really is true that the
company will

726
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,080
build whatever the CEO
decides to measure.

727
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,730
If you're building an
internet service,

728
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,370
ignore things like total
registrations.

729
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:51,990
Don't talk about them.

730
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,950
Don't let anyone in the
company talk about them.

731
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,740
And look at growth in active
users, activity levels,

732
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,930
cohort retention, revenue,
net promoter scores.

733
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,000
These things that matter.

734
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,420
And then be brutally honest
if they aren't going in

735
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,460
the right direction.

736
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,390
Startups live on growth.

737
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,740
It's the indicator of a
great product.

738
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,020
So this about wraps up

739
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,422
the overview on building a
great product.

740
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:10,130
I wanna emphasize again,

741
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,300
that if you don't get this
right,

742
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,980
nothing else we talk about
in the class will matter.

743
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,463
You can basically ignore
everything else that we

744
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,090
talked about until this is
working well.

745
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,390
On the positive side,

746
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,580
this is one of the most fun
parts of building a startup.

747
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,740
So I'm gonna pause here,

748
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,910
I'll pick back up with the
rest of this on Thursday and

749
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,860
now we're gonna have Dustin
talk about why you should

750
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,470
start a startup.

751
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,490
Thank you for coming Dustin.

752
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:31,990
>> Sure.

753
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,100
But yeah.
So Sam asked me

754
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,450
to talk about why you should
start a startup.

755
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,830
There's a bunch of reasons
you might have.

756
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,030
And there's a bunch of
common reasons that

757
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,065
people have that I hear all
the time for, for

758
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,499
why you might start a
startup.

759
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,790
It's important to know,
like, what reason is yours.

760
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,660
Because some of them only
make sense in,

761
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,180
in certain contexts.

762
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,970
Some of them will actually
like lead you astray.

763
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,180
You may have been misled by
the way that Hollywood or

764
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,880
the press likes to

765
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,418
romanticize
entrepreneurship.

766
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,490
So I wanna try and like
illuminate you know,

767
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,970
some of those potential
fallacies, so

768
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,990
you guys can, can make the
decision in a clear way.

769
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,786
And then I'll talk about
the,

770
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:11,350
the reason I like best for
actually starting a startup.

771
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,000
It's very related to a lot
of what Sam just talked

772
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,670
about but surprisingly I
don't think it's the most

773
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,470
common reason usually people
have one of these other

774
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,600
reasons or they just wanna
start up, you know,

775
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,240
start a company for the sake
of starting a company.

776
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,010
So the, the four common
reasons just to

777
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,280
numerate them are it's
glamorous.

778
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,560
You know, you'll be, you'll
get to be the boss.

779
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,700
You'll have flexibility,

780
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,860
especially over your
schedule.

781
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,990
And you'll have the change
to have, you know,

782
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,860
bigger impact.

783
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,120
And make more money than
you'd,

784
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,590
than you might by joining a
later stage company.

785
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,970
So, okay, so uh, you know,
you,

786
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,010
you guys are probably pretty
familiar with this concept.

787
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,320
When I wrote the Medium
post,

788
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,010
which a lot of you guys read
a year ago uh, I felt like

789
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,560
the story in the press was
a, a little more unbalanced.

790
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,900
You know, entrepreneurship
just

791
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,730
got romanticized quite a
bit.

792
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,250
You know, the movie, The
Social Network,

793
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,190
came out, had a lot of sort
of like bad aspects of,

794
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,810
of, you know, what it's like
to be an entrepreneur.

795
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,609
But mainly pa,

796
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,480
sort of painted this picture
of like.

797
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,920
There's a lot of partying
and you just

798
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,060
kinda move from like one
brilliant insight to another

799
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,620
brilliant insight um, and
really made it, you know,

800
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,530
seem like this, like really
cool thing to do.

801
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,630
And I think the reality is
just, you know,

802
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,500
not quite so glamorous.

803
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,800
There's sort of a, there's
an ugly side to being

804
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,500
an entrepreneur and also
just more importantly what,

805
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,290
what you're actually
spending your time on is,

806
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,720
is just a lot of hard work.

807
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,660
Sam mentioned this, but
you're

808
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,150
basically just sitting at
your desk heads down,

809
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,710
focused answering customers,
customer support, emails,

810
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,980
doing sales, figuring out
hard engineering problems.

811
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,330
So it's really important
that you kind of like,

812
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,440
go in with, with eyes wide
open.

813
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,170
And then also it's, it's
really quite stressful.

814
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,660
This has been a popular
topic in the press lately.

815
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,110
The Economist actually ran a
story just last week

816
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,850
called like entrepreneurs
anonymous, and

817
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,560
shows like a founder kinda
like hiding under

818
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,240
his desk And talking about
like founder depression.

819
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,800
This is like a very real
thing, like, you know,

820
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,340
let's be real.

821
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,890
This, if you start a
company,

822
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,690
it's gonna be extremely
hard.

823
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,760
Why is it so stressful?

824
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,920
So, a couple reasons.

825
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,240
One is you've got a lot of
responsibility.

826
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,350
So people in any kind of of
career have fear of failure.

827
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,520
It's kind of just like a
dominant part of

828
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,550
the psychology.

829
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,350
But when you're an
entrepreneur your fear of

830
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,980
failure on the behalf of
yourself and

831
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,890
all of the people who
decided to follow you ah, so

832
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,340
that's really stressful.

833
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,870
In some cases these people
are depending on

834
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,620
you for their livelihood.

835
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,230
Even when that's not true,

836
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,850
they have decided to devote
the,

837
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,650
the best of your, years of
their life to following you.

838
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,840
And so you're responsible
for

839
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,180
the opportunity cost of
their time.

840
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,890
So that's a big deal.

841
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,300
And you're always on call.

842
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,920
If something comes up maybe
not always at 3 in

843
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,830
the morning, but for some
startups that's true.

844
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,080
But if something important
comes up,

845
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,860
you're gonna deal with it.

846
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,050
That's kinda the end of the
story.

847
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,290
Doesn't matter if you're on
vacation.

848
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,080
Doesn't matter if it's the
weekend.

849
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,610
You kinda always got to be
on the ball and

850
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,850
always be in a, in a place,
mentally,

851
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,290
where you're prepared to
deal with those things.

852
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,080
And then a sorta special
example of that is,

853
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,410
is or of this kind of stress
is fundraising.

854
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,360
So a scene from The Social
Network.

855
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,517
This is us partying and
working at the same time.

856
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:10,160
And somebody's spraying
champagne everywhere.

857
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,570
You know, so The Social
Network spends a lot of

858
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,680
time kind of painting these
scenes.

859
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,670
Mark's not in the scene.

860
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,516
The other thing they spend
all their time on is

861
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:21,082
kind of like painting how,
him out to be a huge jerk.

862
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,103
This computer?

863
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:23,980
>> Yes.
Oh.

864
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
>> Okay.
So.

865
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,780
This is an, an actual scene
from um, See it.

866
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,350
I'm gonna move this just a
little.

867
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,346
>> Oh, no.

868
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:35,201
>> This, this will work.

869
00:29:35,201 --> 00:29:35,701
>> This will work.
Okay.

870
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,600
On the PDF as well?

871
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,150
>> Yep
>> Okay.

872
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,870
Okay, cool.
This is

873
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,226
an actual scene from Palo
Alto.

874
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,699
Spent a lot of time, his
desk,

875
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,880
just kinda heads down and
focused.

876
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,778
Mark was still kind or a
jerk sometimes, but

877
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:50,350
in this more like fun
loveable way,

878
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,230
not a like sociopathic
scorned lover way.

879
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,730
So this is him like,
signaling his intention to,

880
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,860
you know, just be focused
and keep working.

881
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,440
Not be social.

882
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,940
>> So then there's also the
scene sort of

883
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,520
demonstrating the like
brilliant insight moment.

884
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
It's kind of like straight
out of A Beautiful Mind.

885
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,040
>> They literally stole that
scene.

886
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,420
So they like to paint it as
you just kinda jump from one

887
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,370
of these moments to,

888
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,630
to the other moment with
like partying in between,

889
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,160
but really we were just at
that table the whole time.

890
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,810
So interestingly if you
compare this to

891
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,900
the other photo, Mark is in
the exact same position, but

892
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,150
he's wearing different
clothes.

893
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,280
This is definitely a
different day.

894
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,650
So cool.

895
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,640
So that's what it,

896
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,880
that's what it's actually
like in person.

897
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,310
And I just covered this
bullet up here.

898
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,460
This is the Economist
article I

899
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,650
was talking about a second
ago.

900
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,660
So another form of, of,
stress is just,

901
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,830
like, unwanted media a,
attention.

902
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,470
So part of it being
glamorous is

903
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,550
you get some positive media
attention sometimes.

904
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,370
It's nice to be on, like,

905
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,600
the cover of Time and, like,
be the person of the year.

906
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,540
It's maybe a little less
nice to be on the cover of

907
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,864
People with, like, one of
your wedding photos.

908
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:56,640
It depends who you are.

909
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,710
Some people would like that.

910
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,890
I'd really hate it.

911
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,670
But when Valleywag like, you
know,

912
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,780
analyses your lecture and
just tears you apart, like,

913
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,800
you definitely don't want
that.

914
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,342
Nobody wants that.

915
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:07,406
And then, one thing I almost
never hear people talk

916
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,432
about is, you're just a of
more committed.

917
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:11,050
So if you're an employee of
a startup.

918
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,800
and, you know, things are
stressful,

919
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,010
it's not going well, you're
unhappy, you can just leave.

920
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,930
For a founder you can leave
but it's, it's very uncool.

921
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,720
It's pretty much a black eye
on the rest of your career.

922
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,110
And so you really are
committed you know, for

923
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,300
ten years if it's going well
probably more

924
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,390
like five years if it's not
going well.

925
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,010
So three years to figure out
that it's not going well and

926
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,110
then if you find, like,

927
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,400
a nice landing for your
company,

928
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,050
another two years at the
acquiring company.

929
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:39,110
And if you leave before
that,

930
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,010
again, it's not only gonna
harm yourself financially,

931
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,170
it's gonna harm all your
employees.

932
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,700
So you pretty much don't um,
so if you're lucky, and

933
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,150
you have a bad startup idea
you fail quickly um, but

934
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,420
most of the time, it's not
like that.

935
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,280
All right, moving right
along um, so.

936
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,400
And I should say,

937
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,640
I have had a lot of this
stress in my own life,

938
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,970
especially in the early
years of Facebook.

939
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,140
You know, I just got really
unhealthy.

940
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,180
I wasn't exercising.

941
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,710
I had a lot of anxiety.

942
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,120
Actually, I threw out my
back, like,

943
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,530
almost every six months,
like,

944
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,490
when I was like, 21, 22.

945
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,020
Which was, like, pretty
crazy.

946
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,890
And so, if you do start a
company.

947
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,730
make, you know,

948
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,540
be aware that you're gonna
have to deal with this and

949
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,800
you have to actually manage
it.

950
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,373
It's actually, like, one of
your core responsibilities.

951
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,864
Ben Horowitz likes to say,
like, the number one rule of

952
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:24,623
a CEO is managing your own
psychology.

953
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:28,710
It's absolutely true, make
sure you do it.

954
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,260
so, another reason so people
especially if

955
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,040
they've already had a job at
another company.

956
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,320
You tend to develop this
narrative of like,

957
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,860
okay like,

958
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,350
the people running this
company are idiots,

959
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,890
they're making all these
stupid decisions,

960
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,050
they're spending their time
in, in these stupid ways.

961
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,970
I'm gonna start a company
and I'm gonna do it better.

962
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,610
I'm gonna like, set all the
rules.

963
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,450
It's a pretty attractive
idea.

964
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:50,190
Makes a lot of sense.

965
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,030
If you've read my

966
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,590
Medium posts you know what's
coming.

967
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll give you guys a second
to read this quote.

968
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:05,729
Cool.
So this,

969
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:07,850
this really resonates with
me.

970
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,660
And one thing I'd point out
is you know, the reality of

971
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,450
these decisions is pretty
nu, nuanced.

972
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,320
The people you thought were

973
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,820
idiots probably weren't
idiots.

974
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,720
They probably just had like

975
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,740
a really difficult decision
in front of them.

976
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,700
And people pulling them in
multiple directions.

977
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,950
So the most common thing I
have to spend my time on.

978
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,510
And, and focus my energy on
as a CEO is like.

979
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,680
The, the problems that

980
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,910
like other people are
bringing to me.

981
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,440
The, the other priorities
that people create.

982
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,758
And it's usually in the form
of a conflict.

983
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:36,460
People wanna go in different
directions.

984
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,500
Or like customers want
different things.

985
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,020
And like I might have my own
opinion about that.

986
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,280
But really the, the game I'm

987
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,360
playing is like who do I
disappoint the least?

988
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,130
And like just trying to like
navigate all,

989
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,590
all these difficult
situations.

990
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,500
And even on a day to day
basis I might come in

991
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,100
on Monday and like have all
these, you know,

992
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,700
grand plans for like how I'm
gonna improve

993
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,480
the company and what I'm
gonna spend my time on, but

994
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,660
then if like an important
employee is threatening to

995
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,470
quit, that's what I'm
spending my time on.

996
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,370
That's my number one
priority.

997
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,240
So a subset of you're

998
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,660
the boss is you have
flexibility.

999
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,110
You have control over your
own schedule.

1000
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,130
This really attractive idea.

1001
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,760
So here's the reality.

1002
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,930
And their Phil Libin quote.

1003
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,860
So this, this truly reson,
resonates with me as well.

1004
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,020
And some of the reasons for

1005
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,310
this, again, you're always
on call.

1006
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,320
So maybe you don't intend to
work all parts of

1007
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,859
the day but you might not
get to control which ones.

1008
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,160
You're a role model, this is
super important.

1009
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,980
So if you're an employee of
a company um, you might have

1010
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,670
some good weeks, you might
have some bad weeks,

1011
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,385
some weeks when you're,
you're low energy, maybe you

1012
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,920
wanna take a couple extra
days off um, that's really

1013
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,900
bad if you're, you're an
entrepreneur like your team

1014
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,930
will really signal off what
your bringing to the table.

1015
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,060
And so if you take your foot
off the gas, so will they.

1016
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,210
And you're always working
anyway.

1017
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,310
So, if you're really
passionate about an idea,

1018
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,760
it's just gonna like pull
you to,

1019
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,450
to keep working on it.

1020
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,800
If you're working with great
investors,

1021
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,000
you're working with great
partners,

1022
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,330
they're gonna wanna be
working really hard,

1023
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,410
they're gonna want you to be
working really hard uh, and

1024
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,890
again, you're gonna wanna
work really hard.

1025
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,680
So some some companies like
to tell the story about you

1026
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,890
can have your cake and eat
it too, you can have, like,

1027
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,900
four day week, work weeks
maybe if you're, if you're,

1028
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,790
Tim Ferris maybe you can
have a 12-hour work week.

1029
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,870
It's a really attractive
idea and

1030
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,780
it does work in a particular
instance.

1031
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,960
Which is if you wanna like
actually have a small

1032
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,410
business or go after a niche
market.

1033
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,500
Then you're a small business
entrepreneur.

1034
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,510
That makes total sense.

1035
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,040
But as soon as you get past
like two or

1036
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,610
three people uh, you really
need to step it up and, and

1037
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,489
be full time committed.

1038
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,740
cool.

1039
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,960
So, this is the big one this
is the, the one I

1040
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,600
hear the most especially
like candidates applying to

1041
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,670
a Asana they tell me, you
know, I,

1042
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,990
I'd really like to work for,
for

1043
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,150
a much smaller company, or
start my own because.

1044
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,180
Then I have a much bigger
slice of the pie,

1045
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,680
I'll have much more impact
on how that company does and

1046
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll have more equity so

1047
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,570
I'll make more money as
well.

1048
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,210
So let's examine when this
might be true.

1049
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,510
So I'll explain these tables
they're a little complex but

1050
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,640
let's focus on the left
first so these is,

1051
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,080
this is just explaining.

1052
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,240
Dropbox and Facebook.

1053
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,550
These are their current
valuations.

1054
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,970
And this is how much money
you might

1055
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,610
make as employee number 100
coming into these companies.

1056
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,620
Especially if you're like,
an experience,

1057
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,140
a relatively experienced
engineer, like,

1058
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,650
you have five years of, of
industry experience.

1059
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,370
You're pretty likely to

1060
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,080
have an offer that's around
10 basis points.

1061
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,140
So if you joined DropBox a
couple years ago,

1062
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,480
the upside you'd have
already locked in.

1063
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,560
As about ten million,

1064
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,170
there's plenty more growth
from there.

1065
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,370
If you leave the company if
you joined Facebook a couple

1066
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,040
years into its,

1067
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,910
its existence you made $200
million.

1068
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,463
This is a huge number.

1069
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:43,726
And if you.

1070
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,840
Even if you joined Facebook
as employee number 1,000.

1071
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,640
So you joined it in like
2009 you still

1072
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,930
made $20 million.

1073
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,350
That's a giant number.

1074
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,340
And that's how you should be
benchmarking when you're

1075
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,770
thinking about what might I
make as an entrepreneur.

1076
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,750
So moving over to the table
on the right uh,

1077
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,160
these are two theoretical
companies you might start.

1078
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,580
So Uber for Pet Sitting,
pretty good idea.

1079
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,600
If you're, if you're really
well suited to this,

1080
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,150
you might have, uh, a really
good shot at

1081
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,148
building a $100 million
company.

1082
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,488
And then your share of that
company is pretty likely to

1083
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:17,459
be about 10%.

1084
00:37:17,459 --> 00:37:18,640
That certainly fluctuates.

1085
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,120
Some founders have a lot
more than this,

1086
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,170
some have a lot less.

1087
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,150
But after multiple rounds of
dilution multiple rounds of

1088
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,950
option table, option pool
creation,

1089
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,730
you're pretty likely to end
up about here.

1090
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,930
If you have more than this,

1091
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,130
I recommend Sam's post on
like the equity split

1092
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,460
between founders and
employees.

1093
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,030
You probably should be
giving out more.

1094
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,670
And then but so basically,
if you're extremely

1095
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,770
confident about building
this $100 million business,

1096
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,900
which is a big ask it should
go without saying that

1097
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,600
you should have a lot more
confidence than Facebook in

1098
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,330
2009 or Dropbox in 2014 and

1099
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,930
you might, for a start up
that doesn't even exist yet.

1100
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,440
Then this is worth hearing.

1101
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,460
So if you have a $100
million idea and

1102
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,750
you're pretty confident you
can execute it,

1103
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,363
I would consider that.

1104
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:05,930
If you think you're the
right entrepreneur to build

1105
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,740
Uber, Uber for space travel,
that's really huge idea.

1106
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,030
$2 billion idea.

1107
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,960
You're actually gonna have a
pretty good return for that.

1108
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,440
You should definitely do
that.

1109
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,370
This is also only the value
after four years.

1110
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,740
And this idea probably has
legs.

1111
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,370
So definitely go after that.

1112
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,730
If, if you're thinking of
building that,

1113
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,560
you probably shouldn't even
be in this class right now.

1114
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,010
You should go and, go and
build that company.

1115
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,042
So why is this, financial
reward and, and impact, I

1116
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,278
really think that financial
reward is very strongly

1117
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:34,220
correlated with the impact
you have on the world.

1118
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,830
If you don't believe that
let's talk

1119
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,900
through some specific
examples and

1120
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,060
not think about the equity
at all.

1121
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,010
So why might joining a, a
late-stage company actually

1122
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,980
provide you a lot of impact?

1123
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,850
You get this multiplier They
have an existing massive

1124
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,520
user base.

1125
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,190
If it's Facebook, it's a
billion users.

1126
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,380
Or if it's Google it's a
billion users.

1127
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,690
They have existing
infrastructure you

1128
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,540
get to build on.

1129
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,760
That's also increasingly
true for new startups.

1130
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,431
Things like AWS.

1131
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,170
Like awesome independent
service providers.

1132
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,598
But you usually get some,
like,

1133
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:07,080
proprietary technology and
it's all maintained for you.

1134
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,870
It's a pretty great place to
start uh, and

1135
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,640
you get to work with a team
and they'll help you

1136
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,250
just leverage your idea into
something great.

1137
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,710
So, a couple of specific
examples Bret Taylor came

1138
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,470
into employee around or

1139
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,240
came into Google as around
employee number 1,500.

1140
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,600
And he invented Google Maps.

1141
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,610
This is a product you guys
probably use every day.

1142
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,550
I used it to get here.

1143
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,170
And it's used by hundreds of
millions of

1144
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,460
people all around the world.

1145
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,320
Didn't need to start a
company to do that,

1146
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,400
did happen to get a big
financial reward.

1147
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,131
But the, the point is he had
massive impact.

1148
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:39,155
My co-founder Justin
Rosenstein.

1149
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:42,300
Joined go, Google a little
later after Brad he was

1150
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,520
a PM there.

1151
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,990
And just as a side project
he

1152
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,900
ended up prototyping a chat
which, which used to be

1153
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,340
a standalone app as
integrated into Gmail,

1154
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,210
like you see it on the upper
right there.

1155
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,105
And before he did that, like
people didn't even think you

1156
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,821
could do chat over AJAX, or
chat in the browser at all,

1157
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:01,065
and he just kind of like
demonstrated it, and

1158
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,220
showed it to his team, and
made it happen.

1159
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,260
Again, this is probably a
product most of

1160
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,310
you use maybe every day.

1161
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,350
And then, perhaps even more
impressively,

1162
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,510
shortly after that,.

1163
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,090
JR left,

1164
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,300
he became employee around
number 250 at Facebook.

1165
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,070
And he led a hack-a-thon
project along with

1166
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,370
people like Andrew Bosworth
and

1167
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,230
Leah Pearlman uh, to create
the like button.

1168
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,350
So, this is one of the most
popular elements anywhere

1169
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,000
on the web.

1170
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,240
Totally changes how people
use it.

1171
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,900
And again didn't need to
start a company to do it and

1172
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,060
almost certainly would have
failed if he had tried.

1173
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,440
Because he really needed the
distribution of

1174
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,310
Facebook to make it work.

1175
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,920
So important to, to keep in
mind the context for uh,

1176
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,440
what kind of company you're
trying to start and like,

1177
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,870
where will you actually be
able to make it happen.

1178
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,710
So what's the best reason?

1179
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,100
So, Sam already talked about
this a little bit but

1180
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,180
basically, you can't not do
it.

1181
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,170
You're super passionate
about this idea.

1182
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,020
You're the right person to
do it.

1183
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,320
You've gotta make it happen.

1184
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,513
So how does this break down?

1185
00:41:01,255 --> 00:41:03,660
>> Cuz we're getting close
to end here.

1186
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,520
How am I doing on time?

1187
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,130
>> Cool.

1188
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,700
Sweet.
Perfect.

1189
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,870
So this, this is sort of
like a word play.

1190
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,690
You can't not do it in two
ways.

1191
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,330
One is, you're so

1192
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,560
passionate about it that
you're just like,

1193
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,110
you have to do it.

1194
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,920
You're gonna do it anyway.

1195
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,940
And this is really
important.

1196
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,270
Cuz you'll need that passion
to get through all of

1197
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,320
those like hard parts of

1198
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,660
being an entrepreneur that
we talked about earlier.

1199
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,470
You'll also need it to
effectively recruit.

1200
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,710
Candidates can smell when
you don't have passion.

1201
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,350
And there are enough
entrepreneurs out there who

1202
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,130
do have passion.

1203
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,250
That they may as well work
for one of those.

1204
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,760
So this is sort of like
table stakes for

1205
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,460
being an entrepreneur.

1206
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,980
Your subconscious can also
tell when you

1207
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,940
don't have passion and
that'll be a huge problem.

1208
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,900
And then so the other way to
interpret this is the world

1209
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,330
needs you to do it.

1210
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,890
So this is sort of

1211
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,000
validation that the idea is
important.

1212
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,260
It's gonna make the world
better, so

1213
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,870
the world needs it.

1214
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,230
If it's not em, if it's not
something the world needs,

1215
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,936
go do something the world
needs.

1216
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:53,680
Your time's really valuable.
Um,

1217
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,240
there are plenty good ideas
out there.

1218
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,230
Maybe it's not one of your
own.

1219
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,440
Maybe it's an existing
company.

1220
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,490
But you may as well work on

1221
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,020
something that's gonna be
good.

1222
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,950
And then the second way to

1223
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,100
interpret this is the world
needs you to do it.

1224
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,420
You're actually well suited
to this problem in some way.

1225
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,080
If this isn't true it may be
a sign that

1226
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,320
your time is better spent
somewhere else.

1227
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
But also just best case
scenario if this isn't true,

1228
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,320
you out compete the team for
which it is true.

1229
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,830
And you just end

1230
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,660
up with like a sub-optimal
outcome for the world.

1231
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,410
That doesn't feel very good.

1232
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,260
So drawing this back to my
own experience at Asana,

1233
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,360
you know, Justin and

1234
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,190
I were kind of like
reluctant entrepreneurs.

1235
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,420
We, before we founded Asana
so

1236
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,250
we're working at Facebook.

1237
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,760
We were already working on a
great problem.

1238
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,470
And we would basically work
all day

1239
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,370
long on our normal projects
and

1240
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,230
then at night we would keep
working on this internal

1241
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,600
task manager that was used
internally at the company.

1242
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,630
And it was just cuz we were
like so

1243
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,080
passionate about the idea
that was so

1244
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,390
clearly valuable, that we
couldn't do anything else.

1245
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,450
And at some point we had to
have the hard

1246
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,760
conversation of like, okay
well what does it

1247
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,120
mean if we don't actually
start this company.

1248
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,020
We were pretty, we were able
to

1249
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,700
see the impact it was having
on Facebook.

1250
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,750
We were pretty convinced it

1251
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,080
could be really valuable for
the world.

1252
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,120
We were also pretty

1253
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,890
convinced nobody else was
gonna build it.

1254
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,670
The problem had been around
a long time and

1255
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,100
we just kept seeing sort of
incremental solutions to it.

1256
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,530
So if we didn't go out with
the one that we

1257
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:11,500
thought was best,

1258
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,140
we thought there'd be a lot
of value left on the table.

1259
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,650
And yeah.

1260
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,970
So we just couldn't,
couldn't stop working on it.

1261
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,010
And literally the idea was
like beating itself out of

1262
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,580
our chest, like forcing
itself into the world.

1263
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,080
And I think that's the
feeling you should really be

1264
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,940
looking for when you start a
company.

1265
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,360
That's how you know you have
the right idea.

1266
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,230
So I'll go ahead and stop
there.

1267
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,650
I'll put some recommended
books up here,

1268
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,562
but won't narrate them.

1269
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:34,860
And maybe, that's the end of
the class.

1270
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,397
>> Yeah, thank you.

1271
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:41,617
Maybe you guys could stick
around for

1272
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:47,560
a few minutes if you have
questions for him.

1273
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,470
And uh, see you Thursday.

1274
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,660
Thank you.

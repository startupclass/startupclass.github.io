WEBVTT

00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:02.670
Yeah?

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.607
All right.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
god eftermiddag och vÃ¤lkomna till den sista klassen i hur man startar en startup

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:10.755
So this is

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.480
a little bit different than
every other class.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.390
Every other class has been
things that you should be

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.210
thinking about in general at
the beginning of a Startup.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.310
And today, we&#39;re going to talk
about things that you

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.080
don&#39;t have to think about for
a while.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.160
In fact, you shouldn&#39;t.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.720
But since, I&#39;m not going to
get to talk to most of you,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.620
again before you get to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.570
sort of post-product market
fit stage.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330
I wanted to just give you the
list of things that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.230
you need to think about as
your Startup scales, and

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.510
the list of the things that
usually.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.070
Founder failed to make the
transition on.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.260
So these are the topics we&#39;re
going to talk about but again

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.380
all of these things are things
that are not writing code or

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.690
talking to users.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.680
Which means,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.990
with a few exceptions that
I&#39;ll try to note, you can

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.946
ignore them until after you
have product market fit.

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:56.098
Most of these things, for most
companies,

00:00:56.098 --> 00:00:58.492
become important between
months 12 and 24.

00:00:58.492 --> 00:01:01.140
But it&#39;s really more about
stage than anything else.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.220
These are things that usually
hit around 25 people and

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.920
definitely post product-market
fit.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750
So just write these down
somewhere and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.860
look back at them when you get
there.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.550
So the first area

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490
we&#39;re going to talk about is
Management.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.480
At the beginning of a company
there is no management, and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.970
this actually works really
well.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.400
Before 20 or 25 employees most
companies are structured with

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.450
everyone reporting to the
founder, it&#39;s totally flat.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.940
And that&#39;s really good, and
that&#39;s what you want, and

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.440
at that stage that is the
optimal way, for product,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.650
that&#39;s the optimal structure
for productivity.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.400
But the thing that tricks
people is that when,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.940
when lack of structure fails,
it fails all at once.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.360
And so what works totally fine
at 20 employees,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200
is from zero to 20 employees?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.360
Is disastrous at 30.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.080
And so

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.900
you want to be aware that this
transition will happen.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.950
And you don&#39;t actually need to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.790
make the structure
complicated.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.540
In fact, you shouldn&#39;t.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.850
All you need is for every
employee to know,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.170
who their manager is?

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.310
And every, and there should be
exactly one.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.780
And, and every manager should
know,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.800
who their direct reports are?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.220
You want to ideally cluster
people in

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.880
teams that make sense of
course.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.380
But the most important thing

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.380
is that there&#39;s just clear
reporting structure.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.150
And that everyone knows, what
it is.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.070
And if you want to make
changes to it people sort of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.710
understand how to make changes
or to hire someone.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.860
Clarity and simplicity are the
most important things here.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.700
But failing to do it is really
bad.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.610
So, because it works in the
early days to have no

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.940
structure at all,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.970
and, because it sort of feels
cool to have no structure.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.910
Many companies are like,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.660
we&#39;re going to try this crazy
new management theory and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.380
have no structure.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.480
What you want to do is
innovate on your product and

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480
your your business model?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.450
Management structure is not,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.590
where I would recommend trying
to innovate.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.207
So, don&#39;t make the mistake of
having-

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:51.410
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nothing but don&#39;t make

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.400
the other mistake of having
something super complicated.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.190
A lot of people fall into this
trap,

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.940
where they think it&#39;s like you
know,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.830
people feel cool if they&#39;re
someones manager.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.370
And if they&#39;re just an
employee they don&#39;t feel cool.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.130
So people come up with these
convoluted circular matrices

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.810
management structures, where
you report to this person for

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.090
this thing, and this person
for that thing, and

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.030
this person for that thing.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.620
But you know,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.470
actually this person reports
to you for this thing.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.414
That&#39;s a mistake too.

00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:17.880
So don&#39;t, don&#39;t try to
innovate here.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.270
This is the first instance of
an important shift,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.200
in companies, or in, in, in
the founders job.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.410
Before product market fit your
only job that matters is to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.270
build a great product, right,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.750
you&#39;re number one job is to
build a great product.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.420
As the company grows and

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.350
at about this, you know, 25 or
so employee size,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.950
your main job shifts from
building a great product.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.090
To building a great company,
and it stays there for

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.430
the rest of your time.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.430
And this is probably the
biggest shift in being

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.220
a founder that ever happens.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.200
There are four failure cases
we see all the time,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.980
as founders become managers.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.980
So I want to talk about the
four most common ones.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.900
The first one is being afraid
to hire senior people.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.420
In the early days of a
Startup,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.310
hiring senior people is
usually a mistake.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.850
You just want people that get
stuff done.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.380
and, and the willingness to
work hard and

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.970
aptitude matters more than
experience.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.210
As the company starts to
scale, and about this time

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.980
when you have to put in place
a basic management structure.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.150
It is actually valuable to
have senior

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.780
people on the team.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.390
You know, executives that have
built companies before.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.110
And almost all founders after
the first time

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.650
they hire a really great
executive and

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.950
that executive takes over big
pieces of the business and

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.080
just makes them happen the
founder says, wow,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.340
I wish I had done that
earlier.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.700
But everybody makes this
mistake and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.840
waits to long to do this, so

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.230
don&#39;t, don&#39;t be afraid to hire
senior executives.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.560
The second mistake is hero
mode.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.260
So, I will use the example of
say someone that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.350
runs the customer service
team.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.420
Someone runs the customer
service team,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.680
they want to lead by example,
this starts from a good place,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.270
it&#39;s, it&#39;s the extreme of
leading by example.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.740
It&#39;s saying, you know what,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.230
I want my team to work really
hard.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.590
Rather than tell them to work
hard I&#39;m going to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.490
set an example and I&#39;m
going to work 18 hours a day.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.400
And I&#39;m going to show people
how to get a lot of

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.900
tickets done.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.600
But then the company starts
growing.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.460
Also they have the normal
discomfort of assigning a lot

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.880
of work to other people.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.820
So the company starts growing
and

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.170
the ticket volume, keeps going
up, and

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.730
now they have to do like 19
hours a day, and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.950
then 20 hours a day, and it&#39;s
just obviously, not working.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.660
But they won&#39;t stop and hire
people, because they&#39;re like,

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.820
if I stop, even for one day,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.930
we&#39;re going to get behind on
tickets.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.000
The only way to get out of
hero mode in this case is to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.860
say, you know, what?

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.010
we&#39;re going to get behind on
tickets for two or

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.170
three weeks, because I&#39;m
going to go off.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.580
And I&#39;m going to hire three
more support team members and

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.470
I&#39;ve calculated based off our
growth rate that this is

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.880
going to last this long.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.620
And next time,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.820
I&#39;m not going to make the same
mistake.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.650
I&#39;ll get ahead of it and hire
again.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.830
But you actually have to make
a tradeoff.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.200
You actually, have to say, you
know, what?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.250
I need to hire more people and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.370
we&#39;re going to get behind on
other stuff.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.510
That is the right answer.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.300
The wrong answer is to stay in
hero mode until you burnout,

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.246
which is what most people do.

00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:01.750
Third mistake bad delegation.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.900
Most founders have not managed
people before and

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.730
they certainly haven&#39;t managed
managers.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.650
And so the way that the bad
way you delegate is you

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.790
say hey, employee, we need to
do this big thing.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.230
You go off and research it.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.710
Come back to me with all the
data and

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.000
the trade-offs, I&#39;ll make a
decision and tell it to you,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.010
and then you&#39;ll go off and
implement it.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.620
That&#39;s how most founders
delegate, and that does not

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.660
make people feel good and it
certainly doesn&#39;t scale.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.410
A subtle difference but really
important is to say,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.030
hey, you&#39;re really smart,
that&#39;s why I hired you.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.969
You go off, here are the
things to think about,

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:37.064
here&#39;s what I think, but you
make this decision.

00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:40.740
I totally trust you, and let
me know what you decide.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.370
That&#39;s the delegation that
actually works.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.490
because, I think, because
Steve Jobs was able to get

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.230
away with the former and make
every decision himself, and

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.660
people just put up with it.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.440
And every founder thinks
they&#39;re the next Steve Jobs.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.050
A lot of people try this.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.500
But I, for 99.9% of people.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.200
The second method here works a
lot better.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.500
And then the fourth area is
just

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.730
a personal organization one.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.590
When you are working on
product,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.410
you don&#39;t actually need to be
that organized in terms of

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.520
how you run a company, and

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.200
how you talk to people about
what they&#39;re working on.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.170
But if you fail to get your
own

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.010
personal organization system
right.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.220
where you can keep track in
some way of what you need to

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.450
do, and what everybody else is
doing, and

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.960
what you need to follow up
with them on.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.270
That will come back to bite
you,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.330
so developing this early as
the company begins to

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.440
scale is really important.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.850
Two other things that we hear
again and

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.260
again from our founders, they
wished they had done earlier.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.460
And that is simply writing
down, how you do things?

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.440
And why you do things?

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.430
These two things, the how and
the why, are really important.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.260
I mean early there is you just
tell everyone,

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.370
employee, when you&#39;re, like,

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.650
sitting around, having lunch
or dinner, you know?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.280
This is how we think about
building products,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.100
this is how we push
production, you know,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.790
this is how we handle customer
support, whatever.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.930
As you get bigger, you can&#39;t
keep doing that.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.740
And if you don&#39;t do it,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.580
someone else is just going to
say it.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.870
But if you write it down, and
put it up on a Wiki or

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.330
whatever, that every employee
reads.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.300
You as the founder get to
basically, write the law.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.600
And, and if you write this
down it

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.450
will become law in the
company.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.110
And if you make everyone read
this as the company hires 100

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.620
and then 1,000 employees
people will read this and

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.910
say, all right, that&#39;s how we
do things.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.600
If you don&#39;t do it it will be
like random oral tradition of

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.660
whatever the hiring manager or
their best friend that

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.830
they make at their first week
in the company tells them.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.680
So writing down how you do
things?

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.340
And the why?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.590
The why is the culture of
values,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.880
Brian Chesky talked about this
really well.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.420
Every founder I know wishes
that they&#39;d written down

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.930
both of these, the how and the
why, earlier.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.470
To just establish it as the
company grows, and

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.990
then this becomes what
happens.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.000
I think it&#39;s one of the
highest leverage

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.561
things that you can do that,
that people don&#39;t.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.170
All right.
Next area, HR.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.090
HR is another thing that most
people correctly ignore

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.080
in the first phase of a
Startup because again,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.760
it&#39;s not writing code.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.870
It&#39;s not talking to users.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.530
But it&#39;s a huge mistake to
continue to ignore it.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.070
And the reason that I think
most founders ignore it,

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.980
is they have in their mind
this idea of,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.990
like TV sitcom HR, you know,
awfulness.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.720
But it doesn&#39;t have to slow
you down.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.420
Actually, it speeds you up.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.690
Most founders will say, out of
one side of their mouth,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.400
people are our most important
asset.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.410
And, the other side, we don&#39;t
want any HR.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.220
So, what they mean is, we
don&#39;t want HR.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.900
We don&#39;t want, like, the bad
kind of TV HR.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.460
What good HR means is, a few
things.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.490
A clearer structure, which
Charlie talked about.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.210
You know, a path for

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.950
people about, how they can
evolve their careers?

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.810
Most important, one

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.100
of the most important things
is Performance Feedback.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.080
again, this happens
organically early on,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.180
people know how they&#39;re doing.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.870
As the company gets to 25, 30,

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.960
45 people, that gets lost and
it doesn&#39;t have to be complex.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.530
It can be super simple but
there should be a way that it

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.740
happens and it shoulder be
frequent.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.110
You know, people need to hear
pretty quickly,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.170
how they&#39;re doing?

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.820
And it should tie you know, if
they&#39;re doing badly to a way

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.340
you get them out of the
company or if they,

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.430
they doing well it should
there should be

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.870
a clear path to how this ties
to compensation.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.912
And that&#39;s the next thing.

00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:20.629
In the early days of a
Startup.

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:22.146
People&#39;s compensation is
whatever they

00:10:22.146 --> 00:10:24.321
negotiate with the founder,
and it&#39;s all over the place.

00:10:24.321 --> 00:10:25.761
As you grow.

00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:27.975
It feels hopelessly corporate,
but it really is

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:30.300
worth putting in place these
compensation bands.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.077
So a midlevel engineer is in
this range.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:34.000
A senior engineer&#39;s in this
range.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.950
Here&#39;s how you move from this
to this.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.223
And it keeps things really
fair.

00:10:38.223 --> 00:10:41.390
Someday everyone will find
that everyone else is comp.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.540
If it&#39;s all over the place it

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.880
will be a complete meltdown
disaster.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.780
If you put these bands in
place early.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.590
It will at least be fair.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.950
It will also save you a lot of
crazy negotiation.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.870
One thing that I think is
really important when it comes

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.930
to HR is equity.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.630
Most people get this right now
for

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.700
the early employees, they give
them a lot of equity.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.120
But I think you should
continue to give a lot of

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.120
equity all the way through.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.070
And, this is one place that

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.290
your investors will always
give you bad advice.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.490
I think, not YC, but

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.164
all other investors give bad
advice here, most do.

00:11:12.164 --> 00:11:15.410
You should be giving out a lot
of equity to your employees.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.850
now, this dilutes everyone,
right,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.000
this dilutes you as the
founder and

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.970
the investors equally.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.690
For some reason,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.520
founders usually understand
this is good,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.160
investors are very
shortsighted and

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.160
don&#39;t want to dilute
themselves.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.690
So they&#39;ll like fight you over
every equity grant.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.850
But we&#39;ve seen a lot of data
at YC now,

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.980
and the most successful
companies, and

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.720
the ones where the investors
do the best,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.640
end up giving a lot of stock
out to employees,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.630
year after year after year.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.870
So I tell founders like, you
should think about,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.580
you know, for the next ten
years, you&#39;re going to

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.440
be giving out 3 to 5% of the
company every year,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.380
because you just get bigger
and bigger.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.790
So the individual grants get
smaller, but in aggregate,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.490
it&#39;s a lot of stock.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.050
And I think this is really
important to do,

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.300
if you value your people, you
should be doing this.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.360
specifically, you need to do
this with refresher grants and

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.550
you should get a, a plan in
place for this early.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.770
You know, I think, you never
want an employee in a place

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.350
where they vested three out of
their four years of stock and

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.320
they start thinking about
leaving.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.800
So you should always stay in
front of

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.710
people&#39;s vesting schedules.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.210
And you know, how they plan
early where you have

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.120
refresher grants in place.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.680
There are a lot of new
structures that people have

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.750
been using here.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.230
I personally like six year,
big grants, but

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.730
six years investing.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.500
because I think these
companies just take

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.250
a while to build.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.120
There&#39;s Pyramid Vesting where
you back weight

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.020
someone&#39;s grant, so in year
four they get a lot more of

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.000
the vesting than year one.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.040
There&#39;s a concept, different
names for it,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.850
but something like continuous
forward vesting,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.780
where people&#39;s grants are
automatically reupped

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.090
every year, at the same number
of shares.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.270
Whatever you decide, get an
option management system

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.360
in place at about this point.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.230
The normal way people do

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.040
this is just someone keeps an
Excel spreadsheet.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.990
I have seen mistakes that have
cost employees or

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.730
companies tens of

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.920
millions of dollars because
they didn&#39;t get this right.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.190
So there&#39;s really good option
management systems or

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:10.050
software and

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.740
you should get those in place
around this point.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:17.730
The other sort of HR stuff to
touch on, there are a bunch of

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.250
rules that change around 50
employees.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.360
Common examples are that you
have to

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.110
start sexual harassment
training and

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.780
diversity training there&#39;s a
bunch of others as well.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.880
But just put a little pin in
your mind that when you

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.750
cross 50 employees there&#39;s a
new set of HR rules that you

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.520
have to comply with.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.110
Monitor your team for burnout.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.371
Again, it&#39;s up to product
market fit it&#39;s just to

00:13:37.371 --> 00:13:39.390
Sprint, now it becomes a
marathon.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.860
At this point, you actually
don&#39;t want people to

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.410
work a hundred hours a week
forever.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.860
You want them to go on
vacation.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.840
You want them to have new
challenges and do new things.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.680
And if you let the whole
company get burned out all at

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.380
once, that, that is often a
company-ending thing.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.140
This is also a good time to
put in place a,

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.000
a hiring process.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.550
Another thing that most
founders regret is they

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.590
don&#39;t hire as soon as
everything is working,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.320
I think you should hire a
full-time recruiter.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.660
If you do this too early,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.540
that&#39;s bad because you&#39;ll hire
too fast, and

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.890
that usually implodes.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.770
But, most founders get behind
the ball on this.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.840
The other, there are a lot of
other,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.250
sort of just hiring process
tips.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.900
For example, I think most
companies,

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.790
even until they get up to say
3 or 400 employees

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.280
should announce every offer on
some internal mailing list or

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.631
something before they make it,

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:27.210
because like half the time you
do that,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.830
someone in the company will
know something good or

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.750
bad about that employee.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.090
And the companies that I

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.430
know that have instituted this
have been really happy.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.820
Also a good time to have a
program in place to ramp up

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.230
employees, so when someone
starts, you know,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.940
what does their first week
look like?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.520
How do they get, how do they
get spun up?

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.920
How do they learn everything
they need to learn?

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.820
Are they going to have

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.820
a buddy that&#39;s going to think
through them?

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.030
That&#39;s going to help them
think through kind of

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.910
everything about the company.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.660
Here&#39;s one that you actually
do need to think about before

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.660
the 12 to 24 month mark, which
is diversity on the team ,.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.610
The most common place this
comes up honestly is people

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.730
that hire, you know, all guys
on their engineering team for

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.891
the first 15 or 20 people.

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:11.940
And in that point you get a
culture in place that sort of

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.470
takes on a life of it&#39;s own,
and most founders that I&#39;ve

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.620
spoken to that have made this
mistake regret it and

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.520
they wished they had hired
some diversity of

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.000
perspective on the team early
on.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.770
Engineering teams are not the
only place where it comes up,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.700
but that&#39;s where you see it
the most often, and

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.550
if you get this right early
you&#39;ll be able to grow

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.660
the team much more quickly
over, over the long-term.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.220
The other thing to

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.110
think about is what happens to
your early employees.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.710
So, a common situation that
happens is,

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.640
the company evolves fast the
early employees

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.910
you know, the company, so like
you hire an engineer who is

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.900
a really great engineer, but
then as the engineering team

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.180
grows you need a VP of
Engineering.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.680
The early engineer wants to be
the VP of Engineering,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.940
you can&#39;t do that, and but you
don&#39;t the early employee to

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.940
leave, they&#39;re an important,
important part of the culture,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.570
they know a lot, people love
them, and so

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.930
I think you want to be very
proactive about this.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.100
You know, you want to like
think about what&#39;s the path

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.770
for my first 10 or 15
employees going to

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.240
be as the company grows, and
then just talk to them about

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.970
it very directly, be up front,
you know,.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.295
I want, like sit them down and

00:16:21.295 --> 00:16:23.574
say, I want to talk about,
sort of where you want to see

00:16:23.574 --> 00:16:25.326
your career go inside of this
company.

00:16:25.326 --> 00:16:26.178
All right, so

00:16:26.178 --> 00:16:30.083
company productivity, this is
something you don&#39;t need to

00:16:30.083 --> 00:16:33.491
think about in the early days
because small teams are just

00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:36.632
sort of naturally productive
most of the time.

00:16:36.632 --> 00:16:37.671
But as you grow,

00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:41.383
it the productivity I think
goes down with the square of

00:16:41.383 --> 00:16:45.097
the number of employees if you
don&#39;t make an effort because

00:16:45.097 --> 00:16:48.586
it sort of one of these like
connections between nodes,

00:16:48.586 --> 00:16:51.880
every pair of people adds
communication overhead.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.950
And so if you don&#39;t start
thinking about the systems

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.550
that you&#39;re going to put in
place, when the company is 25

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.610
to 50 people, to stay
productive as you grow

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.460
things will grind to a halt
faster than you can imagine.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.690
The single word that matters
most, I think,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.780
to keep the company productive
as it grows is alignment ,.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.940
The reason companies become
unproductive is

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.620
people are either not on the
same page and you know, don&#39;t

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.320
know what the same priorities
are, or they&#39;re actively

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.900
working against each other
which is obviously worse.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.870
But if you can keep the entire
company aligned in

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.490
the same direction, you&#39;ll
have one well over half of

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.540
the battle, and, and the way
to

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.250
start with this is just a very
clear roadmap and goals.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.010
Everyone in the company should
know what the roadmap for

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.000
the next three or six months,
or a year, depending on

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.560
where the company is in its
life cycle, looks like.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.760
You know, a classic test that
I love to give is if

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.520
I walk into a company getting,
beginning to struggle with

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.330
these scaling issues, I&#39;ll ask
the founders, like,

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.130
if I walked around and polled
ten random employees and

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.070
asked them what the top three
goals for the company are,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.678
right now, would they all say
the same thing?

00:18:01.678 --> 00:18:04.360
And a 100% of the time, the
founder says, yes,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.940
of course they would, and I&#39;d
go do it, and 100%

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.600
of the time, no two employees
even say the same three,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.570
top three goals, in order.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.600
And founders can never believe
it, because they&#39;re like well

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.650
I announced that in all hands
like three months ago what our

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.190
goals were going to be, and
how can they not remember?

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.710
But it&#39;s really important to
keep reiterating the,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.990
the message about the roadmap
and

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.210
the goals, and almost no
founder does this enough.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.290
And if you do it, you know the
company will say, you know,

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.600
all right, these are our
goals, we understand them,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.235
we&#39;re going to get them done,

00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:37.010
I know self-organize around
that.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.400
But if people don&#39;t know what
the roadmap of

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.640
their goals are it won&#39;t
happen.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.340
We already talked about
figuring out your

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.280
values early, but

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.240
I want to reiterate that
because that also really help

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.600
the company make the right
decisions.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.350
If everyone knows what the
framework to decide is.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.165
They&#39;ll make hopeful the same
decisions if

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:53.200
they&#39;re smart people.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.020
You want to continue to be run
by great products and

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.520
not process for its own sake,
this is a fine, fine line.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.340
Because you do need to put
some process in place, but

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.100
you never want to put process
in

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.310
place that rewards the
process.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.200
The focus has to always be on
great product.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.900
One easy way to do this that a
lot of companies try is they

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.510
just say, we&#39;re going to ship
something every day, and

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.610
if you do that you know,

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.500
there&#39;s at least a continued
focus on delivery.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.520
And then transparency and
rhythm in how you communicate

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.330
are really important, most
founders wait way too long on

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.980
these, but having a management
meeting every week,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.160
of just the people that report
directly to the founder or

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.220
the CEO, critical ,.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.050
All hands meetings not quite
sure how often is optimal for

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.250
those, at least once a month
where you go through

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.900
the results and

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.090
the real map with the entire
company really important.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.300
And then, you know, doing a
plan every quarter of

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.990
what we&#39;re going to get down
over the next three months and

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.010
how that fits into our goals
for

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.830
the year, also becomes really
important.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.620
I put offsites up there,

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.310
because I don&#39;t think people
do these nearly enough.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.280
A surprising number of the
successful companies we&#39;ve

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.860
been involved with do a lot of
offsites.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.660
Where they&#39;ll take their best
people for a weekend to

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.690
a cabin in the woods or
somewhere and just talk about.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:12.680
What do we want to be when we
grow up?

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.410
What are our most important
things to be doing?

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.420
What are we not doing that we
should be doing?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.670
But get people out of the
office and

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.710
out of the day-to-day,
everyone I

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.990
know that does those thinks
they&#39;re well worth the time.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.120
So the goal in all of this
productivity planning is that

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.870
you&#39;re trying to build a
company that creates a lot of

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.320
value over a long period of
time,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.070
and the long period of time is
what&#39;s important here.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.443
You can avoid all of this and

00:20:37.443 --> 00:20:39.832
just like with the authority
of the founder make

00:20:39.832 --> 00:20:42.114
sure the company ships a great
next version.

00:20:42.114 --> 00:20:44.438
But that won&#39;t work for
version ten, it won&#39;t work for

00:20:44.438 --> 00:20:45.390
version 11.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.824
I, I really believe that this
single hardest thing in

00:20:48.824 --> 00:20:52.183
business is building a company
that does repeatable

00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:53.176
innovation and

00:20:53.176 --> 00:20:56.858
just has this ongoing culture
of excellence as it grows.

00:20:56.858 --> 00:21:01.665
If you look at the examples of
this most companies fail here.

00:21:01.665 --> 00:21:05.202
Most companies do one great
thing where the founder just

00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:07.007
pushes to get it done and

00:21:07.007 --> 00:21:11.030
then don&#39;t innovate that well
on follow on products.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.900
And it really takes founders
that think about how I&#39;m

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.970
going to do this second thing.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:16.650
This really hard thing.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.380
To get something like an Apple
that can churn out great

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.850
products for 30 or 40 years,
or longer.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.050
All right, these are super
tactical mechanics.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.230
This is, this is definitely to
just put on a list and

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.380
remember these things for
later.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.320
All right in the early days,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.910
people basically ignore all
accounting and they have,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.100
like, maybe if they&#39;re lucky,
a shoebox full of receipts.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.010
They certainly don&#39;t have
anything that

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.100
looks like a financial report.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.900
This is a good time to get it
in place.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.580
You know, when things are
working, say,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.090
month 18 or whatever.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.410
You can do this with an
outsourced person.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.420
Just say, you know what?

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.720
We want, like to get our books
in order.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.790
We want to start getting
audits every year.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.590
We want to

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.890
start a relationship with an
accounting firm.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.710
Easy to do.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.360
Definitely worth it.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.670
This is also a good time to
collect your legal documents.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.410
Because it&#39;s easy to fix
things now.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.010
So, if you actually assign
someone to go through and

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.270
collect every agreement the
company has ever signed.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.930
Then when your landlord tries
to **** you out of your

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.360
lease and no-one can find the
lease which happens like,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.640
half the time somehow someone
will be able to find it.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.840
Also, you&#39;re almost certainly
missing something.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.470
Some employee didn&#39;t sign
their PIIA or

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.410
whatever and you&#39;ll find it
now.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:29.840
It&#39;s easy to fix now.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.270
It gets really hard to fix,
like,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.350
in the middle of your next
round of financing.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.230
So, again, this is time to
bring, like,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.790
a little bit of the order to,
to chaos.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.150
FF stock is a special class of
stock for

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.210
founders that the founders can
sell in a later round,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.090
without messing up the
common-stock valuation.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.880
It used to be that most people
set this up

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.680
right when they started the
company.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.690
Founders fund sort of
popularizes.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.410
Which is why it&#39;s called FF
stock.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.750
But it became a really bad
signal, right?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.230
Founders that were obsessed
with their own

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.840
personal liquidity when the
company had nothing turned out

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.710
to like fail most of the time.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:06.700
And so investors learn that if
founders pushed on this in

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.110
the seed round it was a very,
very bad sign.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.150
Most founders don&#39;t actually
want to sell stock until

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.460
the company is worth, like a
billion dollars or

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.680
something like that.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.867
So, I think you can actually
safely set this up after

00:23:18.867 --> 00:23:21.454
things start working, in the
next financial round, and then

00:23:21.454 --> 00:23:24.260
you can sell it two, three,
four years down the road.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.050
But it&#39;s a good thing to

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.930
remember by about the time you
get to the B round.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.480
IP, trademarks and patents.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.090
actually, just IP and
trademarks.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.370
So, you have 12 months,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:39.610
after you announce something,
if you want to patent it.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.280
And, if you miss that window,
it&#39;s very hard to do.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.860
so, 11 months after you
launch, or

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.630
first publicly talk about what
you&#39;re doing.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.750
Is a good time to file
provisional patents.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.570
We recommend people just file
provisional patents.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.200
All that does is just hold
your place in line at

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.050
the patent office and it gives
you another year to decide if

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.060
you want to patent something
or not.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.620
It only costs about $1000.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.780
It takes way less effort than
a full patent.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.360
And most of the time you&#39;ll
know whether or

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.820
not you need full patent a
year later.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.170
But if you just do this one
step,

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.080
you&#39;ll at least have the
option.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.660
It&#39;s also a good time to file
trademarks for the U.S. and

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.460
major international markets.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.300
again, if you don&#39;t do this at
this stage,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.050
most people end up regretting
it.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.468
And while you&#39;re at it, a good
time to grab all the domains.

00:24:26.468 --> 00:24:30.090
FP&amp;A, good time also I think
to

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.860
think about someone to start
doing FP&amp;A.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.210
I think most companies don&#39;t
end up realizing where

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.950
the knobs on their financial
model are until far too late.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.050
And I think it turns out that
if you have

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.110
someone build a really great
model of the business.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.990
And by really great,
apparently Roelof Botha,

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.320
who was the PayPal CFO and
built their FP&amp;A model.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.420
The top, the, like,

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.520
the top sheet of his
spreadsheet was 1,500 lines,

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.100
just as a level of the detail
people build these to.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.840
But you can really optimize
the business and understand it

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.300
at a level that I think most
people totally miss.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.310
Most people don&#39;t hire someone
like

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.390
this until they&#39;re many
hundreds of employees.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.060
I think it&#39;s worth hiring
earlier.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.120
Another thing that I think is
worth hiring earlier

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.780
that almost no one does is a
full time fundraiser.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.620
Let&#39;s say you hire someone
like really, really great and

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.670
their full time job is to
raise money for the company.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.840
You hire them after your b
round.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.190
And you say, you know what,

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.520
by the time we raise our c
round we want the evaluation

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.020
to be double what it would
have been otherwise.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.490
You almost certainly get
better results than if you

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.380
hire an investive banker or
someone else if it&#39;s just

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.490
someone internal to the
company and you end up paying

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.570
way less money, and take like
literally half the dilution.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.990
So, I think this is one of
these like, slightly none

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.740
obvious optimizations that
people just failed to make.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.320
Tax structuring, so, this is
another thing.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.330
most, once things are working.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.120
It would be worth you spending
a little bit of time thinking

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.080
about how you set up the tax
structure for the company.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.800
I confess, I don&#39;t know a lot
about the details here

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.260
because I just find it
personally really boring.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.300
But like somehow if you assign
all the IP to like some

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.890
corporation in Ireland that
licenses it back to the U.S.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.050
corporation, you end up paying
like no tax, no corporate tax.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.420
But I know you can only do
that like relatively early on.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.380
And this ends up being a huge
issue for companies that

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.340
don&#39;t do it that compete with
companies that do do it.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.700
You know once they&#39;re big,
public companies.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.610
So that&#39;s worth doing.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.510
A lot of people throughout the
class have talked about

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.750
your own psychology as a
founder.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.630
Here&#39;s what they haven&#39;t said.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.380
It gets worse, not better.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.030
As the company grows, you
continue to oscillate.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.990
The highs are better but the
lows keep getting worse.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.950
And, you, you really want to
think about this early on and

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.570
just be aware this is going to
happen.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.490
And try to try to manage your
own psychology through

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.740
the expanding swings that it&#39;s
going to go through.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.180
Another thing that happens as
you begin to be successful.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.620
As you go from being someone
that most people rooted for,

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.970
kind of the underdog,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.760
to someone that a lot of
people start hating on.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.490
And you know,

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:19.470
you see this first in internet
commenters who will be,

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.190
like, I can&#39;t believe this
**** company raised money.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:22.850
It **** sucks, like, awful.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.150
And it only bothers you a
little bit, but then, like,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.430
journalists that you kind of
care about start writing this,

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:30.310
and it just goes on and on.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.930
This also will go on and on as
you get more and

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.060
more successful, and

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.390
you just have to make peace
with this early.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.100
But if you don&#39;t,

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.760
it will bother you all the way
through.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.990
This is also a good time to
start thinking about

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.090
how long of a journey this is
going to be.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.870
Very few founders think long
term.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.930
Most founders think kind of a
year in advance.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.320
And they think that you know
what

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.370
in three years I&#39;m going to
sell my company and either I&#39;m

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.710
going to become a VC or sit on
the beach or something.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.800
Because so

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.530
few people make an actual long
term commitment to what

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.400
they&#39;re building, the ones
that do have a huge advantage.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.760
They&#39;re, they&#39;re in a very
rarefied class, and so this is

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.150
a good time to like sit around
with your cofounders and

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.490
decide, you know what, we&#39;re
going to work on this for

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.710
a very long time.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.940
And we&#39;re going to build a
strategy that assumes that

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.184
we&#39;re going to be doing this
for the next ten years.

00:28:20.184 --> 00:28:24.664
Just thinking that way alone,
I think is probably,

00:28:24.664 --> 00:28:28.295
a very high leverage thing you
can do for success.

00:28:28.295 --> 00:28:29.150
Take vacation.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.560
Another common thing that we
see is founders will run their

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.950
business for three or four
years, without ever taking,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.650
you know, more than a day of
vacation.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.460
And that works for like a
year, or two years, or

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.730
something like that.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.410
It really leads to nasty
burnout if you don&#39;t do it.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.090
Losing focus is another way
that founders get off track.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.180
I actually think this is a
symptom of burnout.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.960
When you get really burned out
on running the business,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.370
you want to do easier things,
or

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.480
sort of more gratifying
things.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.970
You want to go to conferences,
and

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.630
have people tell you how great
you are.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.990
You know, you want to do all
these things that are not

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.550
actually building the
business.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.020
And the most common post-YC
failure case for

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.960
the companies we fund is that
they&#39;re incredibly focused,

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.260
during YC, on their company,
and then after,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.160
they start doing a lot of
other things.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.660
You know, they, they advise
companies.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.700
They go to conferences,
whatever.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.010
Focus is what made you
successful in the first place.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.420
There are a lot of reasons
people lose focus, but

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.880
fight against that really,
really hard.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.690
This is a special case of
focus.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.480
As you start to do well.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.780
You will start to get a bunch
of potential acquires

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.470
sniffing around.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:43.560
And it&#39;s very gratifying.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.270
And you&#39;re like wow, I can be
so rich and that&#39;d be so cool.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.240
And negotiations feel really
fun.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.360
This is one the biggest
killers of, of companies is

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.590
that they entertain
acquisition conversations.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.040
You, you distract yourself.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.310
You get demoralized if it
doesn&#39;t happen.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.370
If an offer does come in and
it&#39;s really low,

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.290
you&#39;ve already like mentally
thought that you&#39;re done, and

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.190
so you take the offer.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:12.620
As a general rule, don&#39;t start
any acquisition conversation

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.030
unless you&#39;re willing to sell
for a pretty low number.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.800
Don&#39;t ever just check it
hoping that

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.230
you&#39;re going to have the one
miracle high offer.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.610
If that&#39;s going to happen
you&#39;ll know.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:22.530
Because they&#39;ll just make you

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.720
a big offer before you can
meet them.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.220
But this, this is a big
company killer.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.400
And then just as a reminder to
everybody the thing that

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.210
kills startups at some level
is the founders giving up.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.590
So sometimes you should quit.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:46.350
But, if you mismanage your own
psychology and you quit when,

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.670
when you shouldn&#39;t, that, that
is what kills companies.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.800
I mean that is, that is the
sort of final closet death

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.280
in most of these start ups.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.930
And so if you can manage your
own psychology in a way that

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:58.260
you don&#39;t quit.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.580
Dont go to place a where you
need to quit, or

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.320
give up on the startup.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.760
You&#39;ll be in a far, far better
place.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.570
So, marketing and PR is
something that

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.970
we tell companies to ignore
for a long time.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.650
Everyone thinks in the early
days that the press is going

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:14.800
to be what saves them.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.090
We tell them all the time it
doesn&#39;t work that way.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.852
It&#39;s definitely true.

00:31:17.852 --> 00:31:20.511
You know, press is not what&#39;s
going to save your startup.

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.579
But as you start to be
successful,

00:31:22.579 --> 00:31:25.465
this is something that the
founders themselves need to

00:31:25.465 --> 00:31:26.289
spend time on.

00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:28.149
So, once your product is
working,

00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:30.009
switch from not caring about
this,

00:31:30.009 --> 00:31:31.695
to caring about it a little
bit.

00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:33.612
And, the two most important
things for

00:31:33.612 --> 00:31:35.776
the founder to do, the
founders to do.

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:37.920
Figure out the key messaging
yourselves.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.190
Never outsource this to your
head of marketing or PR firm.

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.522
You, founders have to figure
out what the message of

00:31:43.522 --> 00:31:45.610
the compay is going to be.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.930
And once you set that, it
kind of sticks.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:50.190
It&#39;s very hard to change this
once the press decides how

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.760
they&#39;re going to talk about
you.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.810
The other thing is getting to
know key journalists yourself.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.430
PR firms will always try to
prevent you from doing this,

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.080
because they need to have a
reason to exist.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:02.990
And so they&#39;re like, well,
we&#39;re going to

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.310
handle the relationship with
the journalist.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.050
We&#39;ll just bring you in for
interviews.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.760
No journalist wants to talk to
a PR flack, ever.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.260
They&#39;re so much more happy to
just hear from a founder.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.460
I think the biggest PR hack
you can do,

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.640
is to not hire a PR firm.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.450
Just pick three or four
journalists that

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.200
you develop really close
relationships with,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.860
that like you, that understand
you, that you get.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.860
And then you contact them
yourself.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.070
They will cover every story
you ever give them,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.650
and they&#39;ll actually pay
attention, get to know you and

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.140
care about the company.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.100
This is so much better than
the normal strategy of having

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.070
a PR firm blast 200 contacts
that never read their e-mails,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.980
with every piece of news.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.760
so, this is something that I

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.060
think is important to start
doing.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.420
This is also the time in

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.730
a company when business
development starts to matter.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.460
And so, in the early days you
can

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.520
basically ignore anything that
would be like doing deals,

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.390
except maybe fund raising and
sales.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.710
You know, this is the time
when they&#39;re important.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.610
And everything, or many things
that you do,

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.800
like even fundraising, falls
under the,

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.044
the category of doing deals.

00:33:06.044 --> 00:33:07.432
So there are,

00:33:07.432 --> 00:33:11.600
here&#39;s my one-minute crash
course on this.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.130
There are five points that I

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.460
think are important to
understand here.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.640
We&#39;ve talked about this a lot.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.610
Nothing will serve,

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.590
nothing will matter if you
don&#39;t build a great product.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.640
So assume that you&#39;ve done
this before you go try and

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.160
get anyone to do anything with
you.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.680
Developing a personal
connection with anyone

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.000
you&#39;re trying to do any sort
of big deal with,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:33.810
is really important.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.000
For whatever reason, most
founders fail to do this, or

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.150
many founders fail to do this.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.650
But no one wants to feel like
they&#39;re this transactional

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.550
thing, that you&#39;re using them
to get distribution for

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.660
your product, or to raise
money, or whatever.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.820
And, so figuring out some way
to actually care about

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.370
this person and care about
what you&#39;re doing with them.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.010
And not view them, you have to
in your own mind not

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.730
just view them as a one off
transaction.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.140
You have to actually care
about them and

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.460
what they&#39;re going to get out
of this.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.000
Competitive dynamics,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.550
so this is like basic
principle of negotiation.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.780
Most funders learn this the
first time in fundraising but

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.830
it actually matters for
everything.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.170
The way you get deals done,
and

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.410
the way you get good terms,

00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:17.140
is to have a competitive
situation.

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.920
You know, if you don&#39;t do this
deal with party A,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.880
you&#39;re going to do it with
party B.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.260
It&#39;s not always an option, but
it usually is, and this is,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.770
like, the single thing that
makes deals happen and

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:27.500
makes deals move.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.526
Tyler talked about persistence
the last lecture so

00:34:31.526 --> 00:34:34.238
I won&#39;t hit on that again too
much, other than to say,

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:36.354
you have to go beyond your
comfort point here,

00:34:36.354 --> 00:34:37.735
most of the time as a founder.

00:34:40.274 --> 00:34:42.641
And then, the fifth point is
you have to ask for

00:34:42.641 --> 00:34:43.440
what you want.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.790
This is another thing, I still
have trouble with this, and

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.980
certainly most of the founders
we do.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.800
Have, you know,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.640
if you want something to deal,
just ask for it.

00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.830
Most of the time, you know,

00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.020
you won&#39;t get laughed out of
the room and you might get it.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.700
But you have to be like,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.430
at some point you actually
have to say,

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.220
you know this is what I&#39;d like
you to do.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.610
Even if it feels aggressive or
an overreach, or whatever.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.870
So I&#39;m going to close,

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.680
this part of the talk with an
image.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.750
One of the Airbnb founders
drew this on

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.580
like a business card or

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.020
something for another founder
that was starting a company.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.660
And then I saw it once and
took a picture of it.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.510
Because I thought it was such
a good summary.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.395
And what he had tried to draw
here was the Ycombinator

00:35:24.395 --> 00:35:26.612
process as he remembered it.

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.560
And I love it because it&#39;s
like so simple, and

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.510
it looks so do-able when it&#39;s
written on a business card.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:34.850
But you&#39;re trying to find
product market fit.

00:35:36.155 --> 00:35:37.820
You know, you&#39;re trying to
build a product, and

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.260
you&#39;re trying to close the gap
between those two gears.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.170
The only way to do that is to
go off and meet the people.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:45.880
You cannot do this without
getting really,

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.930
really close to your users.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.465
And then he drew this graph
that,

00:35:50.465 --> 00:35:53.395
sort of on a whiteboard at YC
and got in kind of,

00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:57.001
like, one of the YC he writes
a passage, but that&#39;s

00:35:57.001 --> 00:36:01.040
the graph of how adoption goes
for a new company.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.140
So you launch in the press,
you get a huge spike.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.940
It falls off to nothing.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.670
At some point, at least one
point,

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.600
things look like they&#39;re
going to completely die and

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.680
kind of dip below the x-axis.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.690
They recover a little bit.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:12.760
You have this long, long,

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.310
long trough of sorrow before
things work.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.800
In Airbnb&#39;s case,

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.200
it was 1,000 days before the
graph started ticking upward.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.190
You have these wiggles of
false hope, and then finally,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.410
finally, finally, things start
to grow.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:25.610
Three years later.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:29.530
So starting a startup ends up
being this very long process.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.670
It is, you know, it can be
really rewarding.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.480
It&#39;s definitely long, but it
is do-able.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.330
And that&#39;s what I love about
that drawing.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.580
So, with that, I think I have
about ten minutes left.

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.850
I can answer questions on
this, or

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.930
anything else in the course
that we&#39;ve covered.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:44.586
If anyone has some.

00:36:47.013 --> 00:36:47.940
Yes.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.140
&gt;&gt; You have that diversity
being important, but

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.570
an earlier speaker said
diversity wasn&#39;t important and

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.720
you should just hire people
that are very much like you,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.610
and then you can cross.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.270
&gt;&gt; So, here is the the
question is, how do you you

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:03.000
square the device of diversity
being important with earlier

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.030
speakers saying you want
people that are very similar.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.920
the, the difference what you
want is you want diversity of

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.830
backgrounds, but you don&#39;t
want diversity of vision.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.370
Like where companies get in
trouble is

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.540
when they have people think
very differently about what

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.400
the company should be doing,
or don&#39;t work well together.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.570
You don&#39;t want that.

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:25.320
You do want to hire people
that you know, and

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.710
that you trust and that you
can work with.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.630
But if everyone on the team
comes from exactly the same

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.300
background you end, you do end
up developing somewhat of

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.920
a mono-culture which often
causes problems down the road.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.750
Not always.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:39.290
Some companies have been
successful with that.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.880
So what, what we tell people
is, hire people that you know

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.960
and that you&#39;ve worked with
before.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.910
But try to hi,

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.490
try to hire people that are
complementary and

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.160
align towards the same goal,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.470
not people that are exactly
the same.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:56.330
because you just get a, a
better skill set.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:01.560
Yeah.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.340
&gt;&gt; What are some examples of
ways to make a transition back

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.940
to a more personal level,
especially when you&#39;re really.

00:38:11.935 --> 00:38:13.300
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How to keep track,

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:15.770
productivity systems.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.960
So, the one I use, which
actually I think works really

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:25.830
well, is I keep one piece of
paper with my goals for

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.090
sort of a three to 12 month
time frame.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.910
And I look at that every day.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.600
And then separately I keep
one, one page for

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.310
every day of my short term
goals for that day.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.400
And so if I need to do
something in like a week,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.020
I just flip forward seven
pages and write it down, and

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.180
then I also keep a list of
every person and

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.640
what they&#39;re working on, and
what I need to tell them, and

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.550
what I need to talk to them
about,

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.990
what we talked about last
time.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:46.725
So every time I sit down with
someone,

00:38:46.725 --> 00:38:48.298
I kind of have the full
statement,

00:38:48.298 --> 00:38:50.860
a list of things for that
person that works really well.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.067
Yes.

00:38:52.067 --> 00:38:54.296
&gt;&gt; So we talked about that
startup growing.

00:38:54.296 --> 00:38:55.318
But most startups fail.

00:38:55.318 --> 00:38:56.446
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Any advice for

00:38:56.446 --> 00:38:58.167
kind of fail gracefully.

00:38:58.167 --> 00:38:59.844
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:01.492 --> 00:39:03.141
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How to fail gracefully.

00:39:03.141 --> 00:39:08.316
So, most startups fail,and
Silicon Valley almost goes

00:39:08.316 --> 00:39:12.290
too far in how much it loves
failure.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:13.210
Failure still sucks.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.250
You should still try not to
fail.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:15.600
And this whole, like, thing,

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.750
of like, failure&#39;s great, I, I
don&#39;t agree with.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.130
But it will happen to most
people most of the time,

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.930
and it&#39;s a very forgiving
environment.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.920
As long as you are upfront
about it, and

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.740
ethical, and don&#39;t let anyone
get into a bad situation.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.880
So, if you&#39;re failing, first
of all,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.700
you should tell your
investors.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.250
And, second of all, you should
not totally run out of money.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:40.580
What you don&#39;t want is a
blow-up with a bunch of, you

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.800
know, debts that the company
owe, and everyone, you know,

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.950
showing up to work, one day,
and the door being locked.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:47.760
You&#39;ll know when you&#39;re
failing,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.890
you&#39;ll know when the company
is,

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:50.450
things just aren&#39;t going to
work,

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.500
and you should just tell your
investors.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.230
Like, hey, sorry, this isn&#39;t
going to work.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.310
No one will be surprised.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.330
Like, I expect to lose my, or
I&#39;m willing to lose my money

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:00.120
on every investment I ever
make.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.590
I know that happens most of
the time, and

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.540
the winners pay for it,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.240
you know, still with a factor
of 100, so it&#39;s okay.

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:09.660
No one, people will be very
understanding and supportive.

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.530
But you want to tell people
early.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.020
You don&#39;t want to surprise
them.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.080
And you want, you don&#39;t
want to like

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.110
let your employees gets
shocked when they learn they

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:17.950
don&#39;t have a job.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.500
you know, you, you,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.460
you want to shut the company
down in a graceful way.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.380
Help them find jobs.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.430
Make sure you give them two or
four weeks of severance

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.660
payment, so that they&#39;re not
suffering a cash flow problem.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:30.710
All that stuff is pretty
important.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.620
Yes.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.650
&gt;&gt; How many immigrant founders
have you seen in Y Combinator?

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.180
&gt;&gt; How many immigrant founders
have we seen in Y Combinator?

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.170
In the last batch, I think it
probably went up for

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.020
this next batch, in the last
batch 41% of the founders we

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.850
funded were born outside the
US.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.540
From 30 different countries.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.700
So it&#39;s.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.930
Yeah a pretty big percentage.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.199
&gt;&gt; What do you think are other
good places to

00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:54.220
start a start up?

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.390
&gt;&gt; Apart from the Valley where
do I

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.960
think are other good places to
start a start up?

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.430
Well I still think the Valley
is

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.030
the best by a very significant
margin.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.230
But I think it&#39;s finally,

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.470
maybe beginning to weaken a
little bit.

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:09.010
Because the costs have just
gotten so out of control.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:09.690
To be clear, if I

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.720
was going to start a company I
still wouldn&#39;t think about.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.340
I would still pick Silicon
Valley.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.610
And I think if you look at the
data of companies over

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.050
the last few years, Valley
still wins by a lot.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:23.320
But Seattle, LA, lots of

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.560
places outside the U.S., I
think all of these make sense.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.360
&gt;&gt; Like what places outside?

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:31.080
I hesitate to make
recommendations there

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.400
because I haven&#39;t spent enough
time in

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.851
this cities to really have an
intuitive feel.

00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:38.080
but, like, I mean, you, you
know as well as

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.290
I do the common ones people
talk about, startup hubs,

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.150
and I just, I can&#39;t make a
personal recommendation there.

00:41:43.661 --> 00:41:49.443
&gt;&gt; Hire a professional CEO or
like a senior.

00:41:49.443 --> 00:41:50.645
&gt;&gt; When should the founders
think about

00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:51.580
hiring a professional CEO?

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.761
Never.

00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:57.222
you, if you look at the most
successful.

00:41:57.222 --> 00:42:01.225
Companies in tech, they are
run by their founders for

00:42:01.225 --> 00:42:04.482
a very long time, sometimes
forever.

00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:07.130
And sometimes they even hire a
professional CEO and then

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.020
realize that that is not going
to like build a great company.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:15.412
And so, like Larry Page came
back to CEO again.

00:42:15.412 --> 00:42:19.480
I think, if you don&#39;t want to
be the long-term CEO of

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.260
a company, you probably
shouldn&#39;t start one.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.310
I&#39;m not totally sure about
that.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.040
I think there are exceptions.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.380
But generally, that,

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.100
the transition I talked about
today, if you go

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.080
from building a great product
to building a great company.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.910
Being a founder, you know, for
nine of the ten years is going

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.020
to be about building that
great company.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.860
And if you&#39;re, if you&#39;re not
excited about doing that I

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.310
think you should think hard
about, about it.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.050
Yes?

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.088
&gt;&gt; What are some of the most
common and

00:42:47.088 --> 00:42:50.400
most alarming warning signs
you should be looking for.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.650
When you&#39;re trying to make
this shift from

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.289
building great products to
building great companies.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.590
What are the, the most common
mistakes to make when

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.730
you&#39;re shifting towards
building your own company?

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.910
I think I went through most of
them here.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.330
I tried to put everything in
here that I

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.640
see people mess up most of the
time.

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:07.530
Yes?

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.340
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to get
involved in the Y com,

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.310
community before getting
accepted?

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.350
Is there a way to get involved
with YC before getting funded?

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:18.510
No, and intentionally not.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.840
Actually I&#39;ll say the one
thing you can do is if you

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.960
work at a YC company.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.820
And then later apply I think
that probably like,

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.430
well not probably.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:31.440
That definitely if you get a
good recommendation from

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.240
those founders will help with
YC.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.770
So you know, working at a YC
company helps.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.830
But there&#39;s not much you can
do to help and

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:42.890
that&#39;s intentional.

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.292
Like there is no pre start up
in a way that there&#39;s pre-med.

00:43:46.292 --> 00:43:48.042
You should just focus on
whatever you&#39;re doing.

00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:50.170
And when you start a start up,
there&#39;s things like YC and

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:51.870
others that are structured to
help you.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.010
Most of the founders we fund,

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.140
we don&#39;t know at all before we
do it.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:56.990
You know, you don&#39;t,

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.670
you really don&#39;t need to get
to know us or get involved.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.620
We&#39;re, we&#39;re all good that
way.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:01.610
Yes?

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.220
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s a statistic of
saying,

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.450
now harder to get into Y
company then getting,

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.420
getting into Harvard.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.960
So I&#39;m curious, the criteria
that are used,

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.910
think of start-up, does it
change over time, or?

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:14.610
&gt;&gt; The question is what,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.880
what criteria do we use to
pick start-ups and

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.620
has it gotten harder?

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:20.190
Has it changed?

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:25.760
You know, we, the two things
that we need to see are,

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.190
are good founders and a good
idea.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.160
And without both of those, we,
we won&#39;t fund a company.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.210
But that hasn&#39;t changed.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.738
That has, that has always been
the case.

00:44:35.738 --> 00:44:39.330
The applicant pool to YC has
grown quite a bit.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.898
But most of, or a lot of the
growth is, you know,

00:44:41.898 --> 00:44:44.930
people that shouldn&#39;t be
starting start-ups anyway.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.106
Probably, that are just doing
it

00:44:46.106 --> 00:44:47.370
because it&#39;s sort of the cool
thing now.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.210
So you know, if you&#39;re really
passionate about an idea.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:51.910
And the idea is good.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.410
And you&#39;re you know, smart and

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.410
get things done that you&#39;re
executing.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.400
I still think you have a, a
very reasonable shot at YC,

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.812
even though the headline
number is bigger.

00:45:00.812 --> 00:45:01.920
Yes.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.210
&gt;&gt; The certain, certain market
that you&#39;re really excited

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.520
about but don&#39;t necessarily
know a lot about yet.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.420
Is there a certain or ways to
,.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.410
&gt;&gt; Sure.
If there&#39;s

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.250
a market that you&#39;re excited
about but

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.360
don&#39;t know a lot about yet,
what should you do?

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.580
Two schools of thought on
this.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.160
One is to just jump right in.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:20.820
Learn it as you go.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.890
That&#39;s worked a lot of times.

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.170
The other is to go work at a
company in the space or

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.160
do something in, in the market
for,

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.349
you know, a year or two years.

00:45:30.372 --> 00:45:34.030
I lean slightly towards the
second.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:36.453
But as long as you&#39;re willing
to really learn and

00:45:36.453 --> 00:45:39.232
really study and really get
uncomfortably close to your

00:45:39.232 --> 00:45:40.840
users, either case will work.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.230
And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that
much of a disadvantage.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.720
I, I think, all things being
equal,

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.000
I would go spend a couple
years learning about it

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.178
in detail, but I don&#39;t think
you have to.

00:45:52.178 --> 00:45:54.473
Yes?

00:45:54.473 --> 00:45:57.780
&gt;&gt; I have question related to
YC to.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.700
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah so,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.430
I think that YC does fantastic
job in promoting partnership,

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.630
instead of combating.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.380
In fact, as an institutional
investor I actually I

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.260
messed with a suite up at YC.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.666
In past periods, the hardware
has things like you know, you

00:46:12.666 --> 00:46:16.730
guys has 180 companies every
year jumping into the market.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.327
And it looks like it&#39;s hard to
follow each of the YC

00:46:19.327 --> 00:46:20.350
companies any more.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:23.170
Do you think that this will
create some you know,

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.183
if some people will walk away
from YC.

00:46:25.183 --> 00:46:30.803
Because they cannot follow
such a companies.

00:46:30.803 --> 00:46:32.737
The company has to be very
polished and

00:46:32.737 --> 00:46:35.643
the founder has to be thinking
over and over about ideas.

00:46:37.573 --> 00:46:42.723
Easy to access the capital-

00:46:42.723 --> 00:46:44.739
&gt;&gt; All right, so I think the
question is do I think

00:46:44.739 --> 00:46:47.140
investors are going to fund
less YC companies as we grow?

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:48.930
no.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:49.840
Definitely not.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.410
Like certainly the trend in
this is the other way.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.020
We have more and more
investors saying that,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.330
you know, half their
portfolio&#39;s now YC companies.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.160
And they&#39;re looking forward to

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.021
the day where it&#39;s
three-quarters.

00:46:59.021 --> 00:47:00.740
No I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a
problem at all.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.000
I think that is like so not on
my top 100 problem list.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.210
The opposite of that maybe.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.010
All right, one more question.

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.740
Yes.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.810
&gt;&gt; When should a group of
founders raise a seed fund or

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:11.650
the first fund?

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.250
&gt;&gt; When should a group of

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:14.160
founders raise some seed
money?

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.840
This is a great question.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.380
I think that, I think that in
general.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.390
It&#39;s nice to wait until you
have the idea figured out and

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:29.510
initial signs of promise
before you raise money.

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.050
Raising money puts some
pressure on the company.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.740
Some time pressure.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.710
And once you&#39;ve raised money
you can&#39;t be in

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:39.390
this exploratory phase
indefinitely.

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:41.650
you, and you end up having to
rush.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.780
And so, like, if you haven&#39;t
raised money, and your idea&#39;s

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.820
not working, you can, you
know, like flail around and

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.110
pivot until you really hit on
the thing that&#39;s working.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.390
But if you raise money and
your idea doesn&#39;t work,

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.051
you&#39;re in this like oh ****
moment, and you have to pivot.

00:47:55.051 --> 00:47:55.696
And you pivot to

00:47:55.696 --> 00:47:58.560
whatever the first vaguely
plausible idea is.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:47:59.090
And that&#39;s bad.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.780
So I think.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.890
If you can wait to raise any
outside capital more than say,

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:06.658
like $100 or

00:48:06.658 --> 00:48:09.300
$200,000 if you&#39;re necessary,
but ideally not even that.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.670
Until things are working or,
or at least pointing in

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:18.010
the direction of working
you&#39;re way better off.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.135
All right, thank you all very
much, this was fun.

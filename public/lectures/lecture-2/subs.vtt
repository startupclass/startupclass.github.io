WEBVTT

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.530
Uh, before I jump into
today&#39;s lecture,

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.120
I wanted to answer a few
questions.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.050
People emailed me saying
they had questions about

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.830
the last lecture they ran
out of time for.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.290
So if you have a question
about what we

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.480
covered last time um,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.670
I am welcome to answer it
now starting with you.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.290
&gt;&gt; Can you use the mic feed?

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.560
&gt;&gt; Uh, it should be on.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.320
Can you not hear me?

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.543
No?

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:23.439
Maybe you can ask them to
turn on.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.192
Ah, hopefully it will come
on.

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:28.030
Anybody else?

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.898
Yes?

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.827
&gt;&gt; Ah, so one question that
was submitted online was um,

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:36.481
how do I identify if a
market has

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.150
a fast growth rate now, and
also for the next ten years.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.060
&gt;&gt; All right, so the
question is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.088
how you identify markets
that are growing quickly.

00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:45.830
Um, the good news about this
is is this is one of the big

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.430
advantages students have.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.880
Um, you should just trust
your instincts on this.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.150
Um, older people have to
basically guess about

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.020
the technologies that are
sort of,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.930
that young people are using,
right?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.810
Because young people get
older and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.350
they become the dominant
market.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.440
Um, but you can just watch
what you&#39;re doing,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.650
what your friends are doing.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.770
And um,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.185
you will almost certainly
have better instincts on

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:07.700
fast-growing markets than
anybody older than you.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.900
And so the answer to this is
just trust your instincts.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.080
Think about what you&#39;re
using more,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840
think about what you&#39;re
using, what you&#39;re

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870
seeing people your age begin
to start using.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.350
Um, that will almost
certainly be the future.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.450
Maybe I can do one more
question on

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.450
the last lecture before we
start.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.110
&gt;&gt; Um, this isn&#39;t really
last lecture, but

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.260
another online is, how do
you deal with burnout while

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.910
still being effective and
remaining effective?

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Sure.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.900
Um, so the question is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.830
how you deal with burnout as
a founder.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.650
Uh, this, the answer to this
is just that it sucks and

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.700
you keep going.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.340
Um, unlike a student, where
you can sort of throw up

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.870
your hands and say, you know
what, I&#39;m really burned out.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.460
I&#39;m just gonna like get bad
grades this quarter.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.750
Uh, one of the hard parts
about running a start up

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.060
is that it&#39;s real life.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.420
And um, you just have to get
through it.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.080
Uh, the canonical advice is
like go

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.390
on vacation or whatever.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.140
Um, that never works for
founders.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.285
It&#39;s sort of all consuming
in this way.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.380
It&#39;s very difficult to
understand.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190
So what you do is you just
keep going.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.160
Um, you rely on people uh,
it&#39;s like really important.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.720
And founder depression is
this serious thing.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.180
And you need to have a
support network.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.670
Um, but the way through
burnout is just to address

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.140
the challenges, address the
things that are going wrong,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.702
and you&#39;ll eventually feel
better.

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:24.800
All right, so, last week we,
or last lecture we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.850
covered the idea and the
product, um, and I want to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.030
just emphasize that if you
don&#39;t get those right,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.360
none of the rest of this
going to save you.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.550
Um, today, we&#39;re gonna talk
about how to hire ah, and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.130
how to execute.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.000
Hopefully you don&#39;t execute
the people you hire.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.500
Um.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.212
Sometimes.

00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:47.130
Uh, so, first, I wanna talk
about co-founder.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.970
Um, co-founder relationships
are among the most

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.840
important in the entire
company.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.450
Um, and everyone says that
you need to watch out for

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.200
tension brewing among
co-founders, and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.180
address them immediately,
and that&#39;s all true.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.330
And certainly in YC&#39;s case.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.630
The number one cause of
early death for

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.549
start ups is, is co-founder
blow ups.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.125
But for some reason a lot of
treat choosing their

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.710
co-founder with even less
importance than

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.500
they put on hiring.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.060
Um, don&#39;t do this.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.660
This is one of the most
important decisions you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.400
make in the life of your
start up,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.450
and you get treated as such.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.750
And for some reason,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.460
students are really bad at
this.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.150
They just pick someone,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.250
they&#39;re like I wanna start a
business,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.420
you wanna start a business,
let&#39;s start it,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.450
start it together.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.760
Um, there are these, like,
co-founder dating things

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.900
where you&#39;re like hey, I&#39;m
looking for a co-founder.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.740
We don&#39;t really know each
other,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.400
let&#39;s start a company.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.550
And this is like crazy.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.700
Um, you would never hire
someone like this, and yet

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.330
people are willing to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.780
choose their business
partners this way.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.230
Um, it&#39;s really, really bad.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.860
And choosing a random
co-founder or

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.070
choosing someone you don&#39;t
have a long history with.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.580
Choosing someone that you&#39;re
not friends with.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.130
So that when things are
really going wrong, you have

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.560
this sort of past history to
bind you together.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.100
Um, usually ends up in
disaster.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.404
We had one YC batch where
nine of about 75 companies

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:04.090
added on a random co-founder
between when we

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.510
interviewed the companies
and when they started,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.070
and all nine of those teams
fell apart in the next year.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.579
Uh, the track record for
founders that

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.370
don&#39;t already know each
other is really bad.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.840
Um, a good way to meet a
co-founder is in college.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.760
If you&#39;re not in college and

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.920
you don&#39;t know a co-founder,
the next best thing I

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.485
think is to go work in an
interesting company.

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:22.985
If you work at Facebook or
Google or

00:04:22.985 --> 00:04:24.175
something like that, um,

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:26.680
it&#39;s probably almost as
co-founder Rich at Stanford.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.490
It&#39;s better to have no
co-founder uh,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.120
than have a bad co-founder,
but

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.920
it&#39;s still bad to be a solo
founder.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.400
Um, I was just looking at

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.586
the stats here before we
started.

00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:37.920
For the top, and

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.690
I may have missed one cause
I was counting quickly, but

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.700
I think, but for the top 20
most valuable YC

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.500
companies um, all of them
have at least two founders.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.437
Uh, and we, we probably fund
at a rate of something like

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:51.640
one out of ten solo teams.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.813
Uh, so best of all,

00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:55.880
founder you know, co-founder
you know.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.440
Um, better than that or not
as good as that but

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.220
still okay, solo founder.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.580
Random founder you meet.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.820
Uh, again students do this
for some reason.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.460
Really, really bad.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.080
Uh, so as you&#39;re thinking
about co-founders and

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.800
people that could be good,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.930
there&#39;s a question of what
you&#39;re looking for, right?

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.350
And at YC we have this
public phrase.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.220
Um, and it&#39;s relentlessly
resourceful.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.030
And everyone&#39;s heard about
it.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.950
And I think that really is a
very good description for

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.840
what you&#39;re looking for with
co-founders.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.270
Um, you definitely need

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.646
relentlessly resourceful
co-founders.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:27.970
Um, but there&#39;s a more
colorful example that we

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.090
share at the YC kickoff.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.220
Um, Paul Gram started using
this, and

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.110
I&#39;ve kept it going.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.057
Um, so you&#39;re looking for

00:05:35.057 --> 00:05:39.070
co-founders that need to be
unflappable, tough.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.030
They know what to do in
every situation.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.690
They act quickly.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.470
They&#39;re decisive.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.220
They&#39;re creative.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.820
They&#39;re ready for anything.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.890
Um, and it turns out that
there&#39;s a model for

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.960
this in, in pop culture.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.950
And it sounds really dumb,
but

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.240
it&#39;s at least very
memorable.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.110
And we&#39;ve told every class
of YC this for

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.110
a long time, and I think it
helps them.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.300
Um, and that model is James
Bond.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.790
Um, and again it sounds
crazy but it, it, uh,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.790
it will at least stick in
your memory and, and

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.620
you need someone that
behaves like James Bond

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.480
more than you need someone
that is you

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.870
know an expert in some
particular domain.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.160
As I mentioned earlier,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.930
you really want to know your
co-founders for

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.140
a while, ideally years.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.100
This is true for early hires
as well.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.200
But incidentally, more
people get this right for

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.689
early hires, than they do
for co-founders.

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.470
Uh, so again, take advantage
of school.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.060
Um, in addition to
relentlessly resourceful,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.820
you want a tough and a calm
co-founder.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.060
Uh, there are all the
obvious things like smart.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.590
But everyone knows that you
want a smart co-founder.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.330
Uh, most people don&#39;t
prioritize tough and

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.020
calm well enough.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.300
Especially if you feel like
you yourself aren&#39;t,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.300
you need a co-founder who
is.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.510
Um, if you&#39;re not technical,
and

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.570
hopefully most people in
this room are,

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.940
you really want a technical
co-founder.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.012
There&#39;s this weird thing
going on in

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.215
start ups right now where
it&#39;s become popular to say,

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:57.330
like you know what?

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.590
We don&#39;t need technical
founders,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:59.330
we&#39;re gonna hire people,

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.420
We&#39;re just gonna be great
managers.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.250
Um, that doesn&#39;t work too
well, in our experience.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.770
In a software,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.250
people really should be
starting software companies.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.970
Media people should be
starting media companies.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.760
Um, so and in the YC
experience, two or

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.130
three co-founders seems to
be about perfect.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.270
Um, one obviously not great,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.240
five really bad, four works
sometimes, but uh, two or

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.630
three I think is what to
target.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.560
Okay, the second part of how
to hire.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.220
Um, try not to.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.820
So one of the weird things
that you&#39;ll notice if

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.840
you start a company is that
everyone asks you

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.930
how many employees you have.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.240
And this is the metric
people use to sort of

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.180
judge how real your start up
is and how cool you are.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.970
Um, and if you say you have
a high number of employees,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.260
they&#39;re really impressed.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.290
And if you say you have a
low number of employees

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.790
then, then you sound like
sort of this little joke.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.870
Um, but actually it sucks to
have a lot of employees and

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.400
you should be proud of how
few employees you can have.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.700
Lots of employees ends up
with things like a high burn

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.760
rate, meaning that you&#39;re
losing a lot of money every

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.320
month, complexity, tension,
slow decision making.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.180
The list goes on but it&#39;s
nothing good.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.960
So you want to, you want to
be proud of how much you can

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.350
get done with a small number
of employees.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.160
Um, many of the best YC
companies have had

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.840
phenomenally small number of
employees for

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.480
the first year, sometimes
none besides the founders.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.640
Um, they really try to

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.480
stay small as long as they
possibly can.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.610
At the beginning, you should
only hire when you

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.900
have the desperate need to.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.756
Later you need to learn how
to hire fast to scale up

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:25.920
the company.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.142
But in the early days uh,

00:08:27.142 --> 00:08:30.460
the goal should be not to
hire, not too higher.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.360
And one of the reasons this
is so bad is that

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.860
the cost of getting a early
hire wrong is really high.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.300
Um, in fact a lot of the
companies that I have been

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:43.360
very involved with that have
had a very bad first hire

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.260
in the first three or

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.680
so employees never recover
from it.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.390
It just kills the company.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.720
Um, Airbnb spent five months
interviewing their first

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.700
employee before they hired
someone.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.450
And in their first year they
only hired two people.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.740
Um, before they hired a
single person they,

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.650
they wrote down a list of
the cultural values that

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.820
they wanted any Airbnb
employee to have.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.010
One of those was that you
had to bleed Airbnb.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.000
And if you didn&#39;t sort of
agree to

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.610
that they just wouldn&#39;t hire
you.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.510
Um, as an example of how
intense Brian Chesky is,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.100
he&#39;s there being CEO.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.558
Um, he use to ask people
before he hired them at

00:09:15.558 --> 00:09:18.130
Airbnb, if they would take
the job if they got a

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.050
medical diagnosis that they
got one year left to live.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.350
Um, he wanted them to be
that committed.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.980
Later he decided that, that
was like a little too crazy.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.450
&gt;&gt; Um, and I think he
relaxed it to ten years.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.689
But last I heard, he still
asks that question.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.110
Um, but like, you know,
these hires really matter.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.600
These people are what go on
to define your company.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.270
And so you need people that
believe in it almost as

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.590
much as you do.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.110
And it sounds like a crazy
thing to ask, but

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.120
he&#39;s gotten this culture of
extremely dedicated people.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.220
Um, that come together when
the company faces a crisis.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.870
Uh, and when the company
faced a big crisis early on,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.510
everyone in the company
lived in the office, and

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.820
they shipped product
everyday until

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.640
the crisis was over.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.820
One of the remarkable
observations about Airbnb is

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.120
if you talk to any of the
first,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.860
say 40 or 50 employees, they
all

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.040
feel like they&#39;re apart of
the founding of the company.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.480
Uh, and this is really hard
to get right and

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.890
this is really rare.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.470
Um, but by having an
extremely high bar and

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.500
hiring slowly and

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.560
making sure everyone
believes in the mission,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.070
you can get that.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.980
Okay, so let&#39;s say, you
know,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.630
you&#39;ve listened to the
warning about not hiring and

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.700
now you absolutely have to.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.460
When you&#39;re in this hiring
mode, your job is, it should

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.710
be your number one priority
to get the best people.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:30.940
Just like when you are in
product mode that is

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.590
your number one priority.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.870
And when you are in
fundraising mode,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.710
fundraising&#39;s your number
one priority.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.710
Um, one thing that founders
always estimate is how

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:39.710
hard it is to re recruit.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.810
You know, you think you have
this great idea and

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.840
everyone&#39;s going to come and

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.100
join, but that&#39;s not how it
works.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.240
To get the very best people
they have a lot of

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.000
great options, right?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.160
And so it can easily take a
year to recruit someone.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.750
It&#39;s this long process and
you have to convince them

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.280
that your mission is the
most important of

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.160
anything that they&#39;re
looking at.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.200
This is another case of why
it&#39;s really important to

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.960
get the product right,
before anything else.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.080
The best people know that

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.780
they should join a rocket
ship.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.960
Um, by the way, that&#39;s my
number one piece of advice.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.270
If you&#39;re gonna join a start
up, pick a rocket ship.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.570
Um, pick a company that&#39;s
already working.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:13.190
Uh, and that the,

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.960
you know, not everyone yet
realizes that.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.630
But it&#39;s, you know,

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.290
you know cuz you&#39;re paying
attention and

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.310
it&#39;s going to be huge.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.900
And, and again you can
usually identify these.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.240
Um, but good people know
this, right?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.060
And so good people will wait
and they want to see that

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.390
you&#39;re on this break out
trajectory before they join.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.680
One question that people
asked online this morning

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.700
is, how much time you should
be spending hiring.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.650
The answer is either like 0
or 25%.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.780
You&#39;re either not hiring at
all, or

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.300
it&#39;s probably your single
biggest block of time.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.910
Um, in practice, like all
these books on management or

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.160
whatever say that you

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.020
should spend 50% of your
time hiring.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.970
But the people that give
that advice, it&#39;s rare for

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.485
them to even spend 10%
themselves.

00:11:51.485 --> 00:11:54.310
25% is still a huge amount
of time.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.440
Um, but that&#39;s really how
much you should be doing

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.300
once you&#39;re in hiring mode.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.840
Um, okay, so if you
compromise and

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.950
hire someone mediocre, you
will always regret it.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.680
We always like to warn
founders of this.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.160
No one really feels it until
they miss,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.850
make the mistake the first
time.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.830
Um, but it can poison the
culture.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.560
Mediocre people at a big
company cause some problems.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.180
They don&#39;t usually kill the
company.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.070
A single mediocre hire in
the first five will often,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.000
in fact, kill a start up.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.600
Uh, a friend of mine has a
sign up

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.810
in the conference unit, he
uses for interviews.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.060
And he like positions the
sign, so

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.670
the candidate is looking at
it,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.740
while they&#39;re interviewing.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.950
And it says that mediocre
engineers do not

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.140
build great companies.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.120
Um, yeah.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.400
That&#39;s true.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.450
Um, it&#39;s really true.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.940
You can get away with it, in
a big company, right?

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.750
Cuz people just sort of
like,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.110
fall through the cracks.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.420
But, but every person in a
startup sets the tone.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.590
Um, so if you compromise in
the first, you know,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.470
say five, ten hires, um, it
might kill the company and

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.420
you should think about that
for

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.670
everyone you hire like will
I bet the future of this

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.660
company on the single hire
um, and that&#39;s a tough bar.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.180
At some point in life at the
company when you&#39;re bigger,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.090
you will compromise on a
hire um,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.550
there&#39;ll be some pressing
deadline uh, or

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.810
something like that.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.430
You will still regret it,
um, but

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.660
this is the difference
between theory and

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.570
practice, and we&#39;re gonna
have later speakers talk

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.010
about what this, what to do
when this happens.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.220
But in the early days you
just can&#39;t screw it up.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.940
Um, sources of candidates,

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.620
this is another thing that
students get wrong a lot.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.572
Um, the best source by far
for

00:13:29.572 --> 00:13:31.600
hiring, is people that you
already know, and

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.260
people that other employees
in the company already know.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.770
Most great companies, in
tech have been built

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.190
by personal referrals, for
the first at least 100

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.910
employees and often many
more.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.370
Um, most founders feel

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.770
awkward calling everyone
good that they ever met.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.590
And asking their employees
to do the same.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.850
But you&#39;ll notice that if
you go work at Facebook or

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.230
Google, one of the things
they do in your first few

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.380
weeks, is an HR person sits
you down, and like beats out

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.930
of you every smart person
you&#39;ve ever met.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.660
No matter how likely you

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.520
think you are to be able to
recruit them.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.420
Um, and these personal
referrals really

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.230
are the trick to hiring.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.760
So you have to

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.350
like go way beyond your
comfort zone here.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.990
Um, another tip is to look
outside the valley.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:14.260
It is brutally competitive
to hire engineers here.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.310
Um, but you probably know
very good people living

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.300
elsewhere in the world that
would love to work with you.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.250
Another question that
founders ask us

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.070
a lot about Is experience
and how much that matters.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.710
Um, the short version here,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.980
is that it experience
matters for some roles and

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.930
not others.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.910
Um, when you&#39;re hiring sort
of like you know,

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.880
someone that is gonna run a
large organization of

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.870
your company, experience
probably matters a lot.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.160
Um, for most of the early
hires you make in

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.300
a start up, experience
doesn&#39;t matter very much uh,

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:44.840
and you should go for

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.400
aptitude and believe in what
you&#39;re doing.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.279
Most of the best hires that
I ever made in my

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.438
entire life have never done
that thing before.

00:14:51.438 --> 00:14:54.060
Um, so it&#39;s really like is
this a role where I

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.858
care about experience or
not.

00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:59.379
Most of the time you don&#39;t
in the, in the early days.

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:01.361
Um, there are three things
that I look for

00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:02.332
when I hire people.

00:15:02.332 --> 00:15:03.770
Um, are they smart?

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.070
Do they get things done?

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.980
Do I want to spend a lot of
time around them?

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.110
And if I get an answer, if
get, ended up with a yes for

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.170
all thee of these,

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.790
um I almost never regretted
a hire.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.640
It&#39;s almost always worked
out.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.950
You can learn a lot about
all three of

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:18.850
these things from an
interview.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.100
But the very best way is by
working together.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:22.600
So ideally,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.670
it&#39;s someone you&#39;ve worked
with in the past.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.300
And in which case,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.110
you probably don&#39;t even need
an interview.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.910
Um, if you haven&#39;t, then I
think it&#39;s way

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.510
better to work with someone
on a quick project for

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.680
a day or two before hiring
them.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.710
Um, you&#39;ll both learn a lot,
they will too.

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.790
And most uh,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.070
first time founders are very
bad interviewers.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.840
But very good at evaluating
someone after

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.180
they&#39;ve worked together.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.980
So one of the pieces that we
give advice,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.910
one of the pieces of advice
that we give at YC is,

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.730
try to work together on

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.800
a project rather than just
doing an interview.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.880
Um, if you are gonna
interview, which

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.950
you&#39;ll probably do as well,
you should ask specifically

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.880
about projects that someone
has done in the past.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.020
Um, you&#39;ll learn a lot more
than you will with

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.840
brain teasers.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.940
For some reason,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.920
young technical founders
love to ask brain teaser

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.080
questions rather than just
ask what someone&#39;s done.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.390
Really dig into projects
people have worked on and

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.420
call references.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.880
Ah, that is another thing
that first time

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.300
founders like to skip.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.800
Um, you want to call some
people uh,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.710
that these people have
worked with in the past.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.670
And then when you do,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.350
you don&#39;t just want to ask
like how was so and so.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.317
Like you really want to dig
in, like is this person in

00:16:27.317 --> 00:16:29.530
the top 5% of people you&#39;ve
ever worked with?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.200
What specifically did they
do?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.420
Would you hire them again?

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.070
Like why,

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.590
why, why aren&#39;t you trying
to hire them again?

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.740
Um, you really have to press
on,

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.639
on these reference calls.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.720
Um, another thing that I&#39;ve
noticed from talking to

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.290
a lot of YC companies,

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:46.210
is that good communication
skills tend to

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.720
correlate really well with
hires that work out.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.190
Um, I used to not pay
attention to this.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.110
We&#39;re gonna talk more about
why communication is so

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.680
important in an early
startup.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.040
If someone is difficult to
talk to, if

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.710
someone cannot communicate
clearly uh, it&#39;s a real

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.519
problem in terms of their
likelihood to work out.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.968
Also for early employees you
want people that have

00:17:04.968 --> 00:17:06.726
somewhat of a risk taking
attitude.

00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:08.293
Uh, you, you generally get
this or

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.237
they wouldn&#39;t be interested
in a startup.

00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:14.053
But now that startups are
sort of more in fashion um,

00:17:14.053 --> 00:17:17.176
you, you want people that
actually sort of

00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:19.100
like a little bit of risk.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.640
If someone&#39;s choosing
between like Mackenzie and

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.960
joining your startup, very
unlikely that,

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.270
that person&#39;s going to work
out at the startup.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.560
Uh, you also want people who
are maniacally determined.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.410
And that is slightly
different than

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.790
having a risk tolerant
attitude, so

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.900
you really should be looking
for both.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.920
By the way, people are
welcome to

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.360
interrupt me with questions,
as stuff comes up.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.480
There&#39;s a famous test from

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.480
Paul Graham called the
Animal Test.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.470
Um, and, and the idea here
is that you should be able

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.030
to describe any employee as
an animal at what they do.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.760
Um, and I don&#39;t think that
probably translates out of

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.718
English very well, but

00:17:54.718 --> 00:17:58.270
um, you know, you need
unstoppable people.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.410
Uh, you want,

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.810
you want people that are
just going to get it done.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:02.880
Um, founders that end up

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.670
being really happy with
their early hires.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.870
Usually end up describing
these people as the very

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.160
best in the world, at
whatever they do.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.330
Mark Zuckerberg once said
uh,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.090
that he tries to hire
people, that A,

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.510
that he would spend time
with socially and B,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.650
that he&#39;d be comfortable
reporting to,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.610
if the roles were reversed.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.730
Um, this strikes me as a
very good framework.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.830
You don&#39;t have to be friends
with everybody,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.900
but you should at least
enjoy working with them.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.640
And if you can&#39;t have that,

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.962
you need to at least deeply
respect them.

00:18:29.962 --> 00:18:34.220
Um, but again, the,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.675
if you don&#39;t wanna spend a
lot of time around people,

00:18:36.675 --> 00:18:38.990
uh, you should sort of trust
your instincts on that.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.170
While I&#39;m on this topic of
hiring uh,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.500
I want to talk about
employee equity.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.090
Founders screw this up all
the time.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.780
Um, I think that as a rough
guideline you should aim to

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.590
give 10% of the company to
the first ten employees.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.680
Um, they have to earn it
over four years anyway.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.650
And if they&#39;re successful,

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.050
they&#39;re gonna contribute way
more than that.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.930
Uh, they&#39;re gonna increase
the value of

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.610
the company by way more than
that.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.440
Um, and if not, then they
won&#39;t be around anyway.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.860
So for whatever reason
founders are usually

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.220
very stingy with equity to
employees and

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.330
very generous with equity to
investors.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.490
And I think this is totally
backwards, um,

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.370
I think this is one of the
things founders screw up

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.490
the most often.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.340
You know, employees will
only add more

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.640
value over time.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.470
Investors sort of like write
the check, and

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.910
then despite a lot of big
promises,

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.160
don&#39;t usually do that much.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.340
Sometimes they do.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.980
Um, but, but your employees
are really the ones that

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.160
build the company over years
and years.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.550
So I believe in like
fighting with investors to

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.320
reduce the amount of equity
they get.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.670
Um, and then being as gen,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.440
generous as you possibly can
with employees.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.149
Um, the YC companies that
have done this well,

00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:48.064
the YC companies that have
been super generous with

00:19:48.064 --> 00:19:51.113
equity to early employees in
general are the most

00:19:51.113 --> 00:19:53.248
succesful ones that we&#39;ve
funded.

00:19:53.248 --> 00:19:56.409
Um, all right.

00:19:56.409 --> 00:19:59.591
So one thing that founders
forget is that after they

00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:01.959
ah, after that they hire
employees,

00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:03.593
they have to retain them.

00:20:03.593 --> 00:20:05.728
I&#39;m not gonna go into a huge
amount of detail here,

00:20:05.728 --> 00:20:07.873
cuz we&#39;re gonna have a full
lecture on this later.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.108
Um, but I do wanna talk
about it a little bit.

00:20:10.108 --> 00:20:13.026
Because founders get this
wrong so often.

00:20:13.026 --> 00:20:14.125
Um, you have to make

00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:16.990
sure that your employees are
happy and feel valued.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.541
This is one of

00:20:17.541 --> 00:20:19.707
the reasons that big equity
grants are important.

00:20:19.707 --> 00:20:21.003
Um, people in the excitement
of

00:20:21.003 --> 00:20:23.400
joining a startup don&#39;t
think about it much.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.710
But if they come in day
after day, year after year,

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.910
um if they feel like they&#39;ve
been treated unfairly,

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.140
that will really start to
grate on them,

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.790
uh, and resentment will
build.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:32.690
But more than that,

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.040
learning just a little bit
of management skill,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.810
which first time CEOs are
usually terrible at,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.330
uh, goes a long way.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.280
Um, one of the speakers at
YC this summer, uh, who,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.780
who is not extremely
successful.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.590
But struggled early on and

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.930
had his team turn over a few
times.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.069
Someone asked him what his
biggest learning was.

00:20:50.069 --> 00:20:52.201
And he said that it turns
out you shouldn&#39;t tell your

00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:53.848
employees they&#39;re fucking up
every day

00:20:53.848 --> 00:20:56.133
unless you&#39;d like them all
to leave because they will.

00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:57.076
&gt;&gt; Laugh.

00:20:57.076 --> 00:20:58.594
&gt;&gt; Um, but as a founder this
is

00:20:58.594 --> 00:21:01.230
this like very natural
instinct, right?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.910
You think you can do
everything the best?

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:04.770
And, it&#39;s easy to

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.690
tell people when they&#39;re not
doing it well.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.520
So, learning just a little
bit here will

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.240
prevent this like massive
team churn.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.150
It also doesn&#39;t come
naturally to

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.760
most founders to really
praise their team.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.580
Um, it took me a while to
learn this too.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.580
You have to let your team
get all the credit for

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.380
everything good that
happens, and

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.600
you take responsibility for
the bad stuff.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.730
You have to not micromanage.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.160
You have to like continually
give people new areas of

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.190
responsibility.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.070
These are not the things
that

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.990
most founders think about.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.690
Um, I think the best thing
you can do is be aware that

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.750
as a first time founder, you
are likely to be a very bad

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.380
manager and try to
overcompensate for that.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.190
Uh, Dan Pink talks about
these three things that

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.030
motivate people to do great
work, autonomy, autonomy,

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.530
mastery and purpose.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.130
Um, I never thought about
that when I was running my

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.110
company, but I&#39;ve thought
about it since.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.470
And I think that&#39;s actually
right, and

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.010
I think it&#39;s worth trying to
think about that.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.710
Um, it also took me a while
to learn to do

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.360
things like one and ones and
give clear feedback.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.860
All of these things that
first time CEOs just don&#39;t

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.180
do, uh, until they get
burned a few times.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.830
But maybe, maybe I can save
you from doing that.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.670
All right.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.620
And the last part on the
team section uh,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.160
is about firing people when
it&#39;s not working.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.470
Um, no matter what I say
here,

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.610
this is not gonna prevent
anyone from doing it wrong.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.390
And the reason is that
firing people is one of

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.950
the worst parts of running a
company.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.750
Um, actually in my own
experience I

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.540
think it is the worst.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.210
Uh, every first time founder
waits too long.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.800
Everyone hopes that an
employee will turn around.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.580
But the right answer is to

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.410
fire fast when it&#39;s not
working out.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.430
Um, It&#39;s better for the
company.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.200
It&#39;s also better for the
employee.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.450
But it&#39;s so painful and so

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.210
awful that everyone gets it
wrong the first few times.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.920
Um, in addition to firing
people who

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.230
are doing bad at their job.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.620
You also wanna fire people
who A, create an office

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.170
politics, and B, who were
persistently negative.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.090
Um, the rest of the company
is always aware

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.830
of employees doing things
like this.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.360
And it&#39;s just this huge
drag,

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.620
it&#39;s completely toxic to the
company.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.930
Ah, again, this is an
example of something that

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.470
might work okay in a big
company,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.870
although I&#39;m still
skeptical.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.880
But will kill a startup.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.550
So I think you need to watch
out for

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.460
people that are, yes?

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.584
&gt;&gt; How do you balance firing
people fast, and

00:23:15.584 --> 00:23:17.472
making your other employees
feel like

00:23:17.472 --> 00:23:19.962
they&#39;re secure even if they
screw up sometimes?

00:23:19.962 --> 00:23:20.748
Cuz you don&#39;t want them to

00:23:20.748 --> 00:23:22.370
feel like they&#39;re out the
door on the first mistake.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.350
So the question is how do
you fi,

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.350
balance firing people fast
and

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.570
making the early employees
feel secure?

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.480
Um, the answer is the, when
an employee is not working,

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.510
it&#39;s not like they screw up
once or twice.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.500
Um, anyone will screw up
once or

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.280
twice, or more times than
that.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.640
Ah, and, you know, you
should be like very loving,

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.790
not take it out on them.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.720
Like, be a teamwork
together.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.500
Ah, if someone is getting
every decision wrong,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.630
that&#39;s when you need to act.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.860
And at that point,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.330
it&#39;ll, it&#39;ll be painfully
aware to everyone.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.330
It&#39;s not a case of the few
screw ups.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.360
It&#39;s a case where every time
someone does something you

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.710
would&#39;ve done the opposite
yourself.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.580
You don&#39;t get to make their
decisions, but

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.700
you do get to choose the
decision makers.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.780
And if someone&#39;s doing
everything wrong uh,

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.640
just like a consistent thing
over like a period of

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.100
many weeks or a month.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.130
You&#39;ll be aware of it.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.570
This is one of those cases
where in theory it sounds

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.650
complicated to be sure what
you&#39;re talking about.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.790
And in practice there&#39;s
almost never any doubt.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.914
It&#39;s the difference between
someone making one or two

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:28.000
mistakes and just constantly
screwing everything up, or

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.030
causing problems, or making
everyone unhappy is,

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.580
is painfully obvious the
first time you see it.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.690
Yes?

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.310
&gt;&gt; When should cofounders
decide on the equity split?

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.020
&gt;&gt; Great question, when
should cofounders decide on

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.450
the equity split?

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.700
Uh, for some reason, I&#39;ve
never really been sure why

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.243
this is, a lot of founders,
a lot of cofounders like to

00:24:48.243 --> 00:24:50.410
ah, leave this off for a
very long time.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.090
You know, they&#39;ll even

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.880
sign the incorporation
documents in some crazy way,

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.380
so that they can wait to
have this discussion.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.060
This is not a discussion
that gets easier with time.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.760
Um, you want to set this uh,
ideally you

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.870
know very soon after you
start working together.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.070
Um, and it should be near
equal.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.490
Um, if you&#39;re not willing to
give someone,

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.580
your cofounder, you know,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.650
like an equal share of the
equity.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.370
Uh, I think that should make
you think hard

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.630
about whether or not you
want them as a cofounder.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.730
Um, but in any case,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.910
you should try to have the
ink dry on this before

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.180
the company gets too far
along.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.400
Like certainly in the first
number of weeks.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.236
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Inexperience can be

00:25:27.236 --> 00:25:30.685
okay uh, but then how do you
know if it&#39;s gonna be

00:25:30.685 --> 00:25:32.808
crippling and you fire them?

00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:34.490
That way
&gt;&gt; Um,

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:37.820
so the question is I said
that inexperience is okay.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.731
Um, how do you know if
that&#39;s going to,

00:25:39.731 --> 00:25:42.375
you know, I someone is going
to scale pass, not scale up

00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:45.390
to a roll as things go on
and later become crippling.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.190
Um, people that are really
smart, and

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:50.160
they can learn new things
can almost always find

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.070
a role in the company as
time goes on.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.690
You may can move them into
something else,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.540
something other than where
they started.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.730
Um, you know, it may be that
you hire someone to

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.820
lead the engineering team
that, over time,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.750
can&#39;t scale as you get up to
50 people.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.240
And you give him a different
role.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.150
Um, really good people,
though,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.670
can almost always find some
great place in the company.

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.615
I have not seen that be a
problem too often.

00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:11.586
&gt;&gt; What if your relationship
with your founder or

00:26:11.586 --> 00:26:13.050
founders breaks down over
time and

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.080
you&#39;re ready to split equity
and everything?

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.963
What&#39;s the best way to
&gt;&gt; All

00:26:17.963 --> 00:26:21.191
right, so the question is,
what happens when your

00:26:21.191 --> 00:26:24.437
relationship with your
co-founder falls apart.

00:26:24.437 --> 00:26:26.560
Um, we&#39;re gonna have a
session on mechanics.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.720
At, near the end of the
course.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.380
But here&#39;s the most
important thing that

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.710
founders screw up.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:33.870
Which is every foun, every
cofounder of,

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:36.650
you yourself, of course, has
to have vesting.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.300
Um, basically what you&#39;re
doing with

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.875
cofounder vesting is you&#39;re

00:26:39.875 --> 00:26:43.030
pre-negotiating what happens
if one of you leaves.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.980
And so the normal stance on
this in Silicon Valley

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.330
is that it takes four years.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.180
Let&#39;s say you split the
equity 50 50?

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.470
It takes four years to earn
all of that.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.830
Um, and the clock doesn&#39;t
start until one year in.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.040
So if you leave after one
year,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.380
you keep 25% of the equity.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.000
If you leave after two
years, 50 and

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.260
on and on like that.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.570
Um, if you don&#39;t do that and
if you have a huge fallout

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.750
and one founder leaves early
on with half the company uh,

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.310
you have uh, like this dead
weight uh, of the uh,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.710
on your equity table.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.880
And it&#39;s very hard to get
investors to fund you or

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.130
to do anything else.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.040
So number one piece of
advice to prevent that

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.790
is to have vesting on the
equity.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.010
Uh, we pretty much won&#39;t
fund a company now,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.420
where the founders don&#39;t
have vested equity

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.580
vesting equity, cuz it&#39;s
just that bad.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.250
The other thing to do is as
soon as problems come up

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.360
in the relationship between
the cofounders,

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.940
which happens to some degree
in every company.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.700
Um, talk about it early,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.155
don&#39;t let it just sit off
there and fester.

00:27:40.155 --> 00:27:43.215
If you have to choose
between hiring an employee

00:27:43.215 --> 00:27:46.886
that&#39;s not ideal and losing
your customer, you lose one

00:27:46.886 --> 00:27:49.940
of the particular working
&gt;&gt; If you have to choose

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.560
between hiring a suboptimal
employee and losing

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.250
your customers to your
competitor what do you do?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.732
Um, if it would be one of
the first five,

00:27:58.732 --> 00:28:01.060
say employees of the
company.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.080
Uh, I would lose those
customers.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.150
Um, I just,

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.830
I think the damage that it
does to the company.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.060
Um, you, you know, you don&#39;t
wanna, it&#39;s better to lose

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.980
some customers than kill the
company.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.310
Um, later on I might have a
slightly different opinion,

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.860
but it&#39;s really hard to say
in the general case.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.302
How about one more question,
and I&#39;ll keep going, yes?

00:28:20.302 --> 00:28:22.304
&gt;&gt; Uh, what&#39;s your
experience with cofounders

00:28:22.304 --> 00:28:24.368
who aren&#39;t working uh, in
the same location?

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:25.124
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m gonna get to that
later.

00:28:25.124 --> 00:28:27.018
The question is what about
cofounders that are not

00:28:27.018 --> 00:28:29.170
working in the same
location.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:30.500
&gt;&gt; Um, don&#39;t do it.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.610
I am skeptical of remote
teams in general.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.770
But in the early days of a
startup where

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.010
communication and speed
outweigh everything else.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.750
Um, for whatever reason,
video conferencing or

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.410
calls just don&#39;t work that
well.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.710
The data on this is look at
the say, like,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.960
30 most successful software
startups of all time.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.960
And try to point to a single
example

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.330
where the cofounders were in
different locations.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.260
It&#39;s really, really tough.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.370
Um, all right.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.948
We&#39;ll skip a little bit of
this.

00:29:03.948 --> 00:29:04.848
All right.

00:29:06.842 --> 00:29:09.830
So, now we&#39;re gonna talk
about execution.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.650
Um, execution for most
founders is

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.850
not the more fun part of
starting a company.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.850
But it is often the most
critical.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.900
Um, most people that start a
company think that they

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.630
are signing up to have this
brilliant idea.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.340
And, you know, then they&#39;re
just going to be,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.870
like, be on magazine covers
and go to parties.

00:29:28.493 --> 00:29:30.483
&gt;&gt; But really what it&#39;s
about more than

00:29:30.483 --> 00:29:33.563
anything else, what, what
being a founder means is, is

00:29:33.563 --> 00:29:36.642
signing up for this year&#39;s
long grind on execution, and

00:29:36.642 --> 00:29:38.200
you can&#39;t outsource this.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.160
Um, the way to have a
company that executes well

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.830
is to execute well yourself.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.310
Everything in startup gets
modeled after the founders.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.409
Whatever the founders do
becomes the culture.

00:29:49.409 --> 00:29:51.705
So if you want a culture
where people work hard and

00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:54.169
pay attention to detail and
focus on the customer and

00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.897
are frugal um,

00:29:54.897 --> 00:29:57.148
you have to do it yourself
there is no other way.

00:29:57.148 --> 00:29:59.644
You cannot hire a COO and
have them, you know,

00:29:59.644 --> 00:30:01.827
do this while you go off to
conferences.

00:30:01.827 --> 00:30:03.597
The company just needs to
see you as

00:30:03.597 --> 00:30:05.680
like this maniacal execution
machine.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.140
As I said in the first
lecture,

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.890
there&#39;s like a hundred times
at least more people with

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.580
great ideas.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.920
Than people that are willing
to put in the effort,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.110
um, to execute them well.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.290
Ideas by themselves are not
worth anything.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.520
Only executing well is what,
what adds value,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.480
or what creates value.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.860
A big part of execution is
just putting in the effort.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.880
Um, but there is a lot you
can learn about how to

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.370
be good at it and so we&#39;re
gonna have I

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.730
think three classes that
just talk about this.

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.284
Uh, so the CEO, people have
asked me a bunch of

00:30:36.284 --> 00:30:38.795
times like the jobs of the
start up CEO.

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.393
And there are probably more
than five but, you know,

00:30:41.393 --> 00:30:44.540
here are five that come up a
lot in the early days.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.420
Um, the first four,

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.830
I think everyone thinks of
as CEO jobs.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:49.506
Set the vision.

00:30:49.506 --> 00:30:50.489
Raise money.

00:30:50.489 --> 00:30:52.919
Evangelize the company to
people you&#39;re trying to

00:30:52.919 --> 00:30:53.432
recruit.

00:30:53.432 --> 00:30:55.308
Existing employees,
partners, press,

00:30:55.308 --> 00:30:56.970
customers, everybody.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.380
Hire and manage the team.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.030
Um, but the fifth one is
setting the execution bar,

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:03.940
and this is not something
that

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.470
most founders get excited
about.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.630
Probably think about
themselves doing that I

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.900
think is actually one of the
critical CEO roles.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.270
And no one but the CEO can
do this.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.570
Um execution gets divided
into two, two key questions.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.580
One can you figure out what
to do?

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.860
And two can you get it done?

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.970
Um so I wanna talk about two
parts of getting it done.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.010
Assuming that you&#39;ve already
figured out what to do.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.120
Um, and those are focus and
intensity.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.120
Ah, so, so focus is
critical.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.240
Um, one of my favorite
questions to ask founders

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.580
is what they&#39;re spending
their time and money on.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.700
Um, this reveals almost
everything,

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.040
about what founders think is
important.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.560
One of the hardest parts
about being a founder.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.670
Is it there are 100
important

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.160
things competing for your
attention every day.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.560
Um, and you have to identify
the right two or three, work

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.000
on those and then ignore or
delegate or defer the rest.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.180
And a lot of these things
that,

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.450
that founders think are
really important, you know.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:01.880
Interviewing a lot of
different law firms,

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.290
going to conferences,
recruiting advisors,

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.970
whatever, they just don&#39;t
matter, right?

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.360
And what really does matter,
varies with time but

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.841
it&#39;s an important piece of
May Day advice.

00:32:12.841 --> 00:32:14.170
You need to figure out what
the two or

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.500
three most important things
are and then just do those.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.352
And you can only have two or
three things every day,

00:32:19.352 --> 00:32:21.088
because everything else will
just come at you.

00:32:21.088 --> 00:32:22.389
You know fires of the day,
and

00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:24.837
if you don&#39;t get really good
at setting what these two or

00:32:24.837 --> 00:32:26.790
three priorities are every
day.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.720
Um, you&#39;ll never be great at
actually getting stuff done.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.660
This is really hard for
founders right.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.780
Founders are people that get

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.110
excited by starting new
things.

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.400
Unfortunately, the trick to
great execution is to

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.530
say no a lot.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:43.110
You know, you&#39;re saying no
97 times out of 100,

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:45.370
um, and most founders find
that they have to

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.090
make a very conscious effort
to do this.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.940
Most startups are not nearly
focused enough.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.840
They work really hard,
maybe, but

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.560
they don&#39;t work hard on the
right things.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.020
And you&#39;ll still fail.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.120
Um, one of the great and

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.570
terrible things about
starting a startup is that

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.240
you get no credit for
trying.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.210
You only get points when you

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.460
make something that the
market wants.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.770
So if you work really hard
on the wrong things.

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:08.510
Uh, no one will care.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.610
So then there&#39;s this
question of how do

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.310
you figure out what to focus
on each day?

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.200
And this is where it&#39;s
really important to

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.820
have goals.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.730
Most good founders that I
know uh,

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.930
at any given time have a
small number of

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.830
overarching goals for the
company.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.060
Everybody in the company
knows.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.920
Could be things like ship a
product by this date.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.130
You know, maintain this
growth rate,

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.880
get this certain engagement
rate, hire for

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.690
these key roles, get this
deal done.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.440
But anybody could tell you
in the company every week

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.560
what are our, what are our
key goals?

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.210
And then everybody executes
based off of that.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.590
The founder really does set
the focus.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.440
Um, whatever the founder
cares about,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.800
whatever the founders think
are the key goals.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.660
Um, that&#39;s going to

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.930
be what the whole company
focuses on.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.560
And, and the best founders
repeat these goals over and

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.850
over far more often than
they

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.480
think they should need to.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.450
They put em up on the walls,

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.880
they talk about them in one
on one&#39;s,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.410
all hands meeting every
week.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.820
Um, but it keeps the company
focused.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.615
One of the keys to focus on
why I said I think.

00:34:06.615 --> 00:34:09.610
Co-founders in different
places struggle is that

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.520
you can&#39;t be focused without
really great communication.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.430
Um, even if you only have
say four or

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:15.850
five people in a company.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.410
A small communication
breakdown is enough for

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.350
everybody to be working on
slightly different things.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.030
Um, and then you lose focus
and

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.590
the company just scrambles.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:32.260
I&#39;m going to talk about this
a little bit more later.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:33.900
Um, but growth and

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.900
momentum are something you
can never lose focus on.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.340
Uh, growth and momentum are
what a start up lives on.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.160
Uh, and you always have to
focus on maintaining these.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:44.950
You should always know how
you

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.530
are doing against your
metrics.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:47.710
You should have a weekly
review meeting every

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:48.990
week and you should be

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:52.120
extremely suspicious if
you&#39;re ever talking about.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.170
We&#39;re not focused on growth
right now,

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.320
we&#39;re not growing that well
right now, but

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.220
we&#39;re doing this other
thing, you know.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.010
We don&#39;t have, we don&#39;t have
a timeline for when we&#39;re

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.610
gonna ship this cuz were
focused on this other thing.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.370
We&#39;re doing a rebrand,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:06.150
whatever, almost always a
disaster.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.120
So you wanna have the right
metrics and

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.210
you want to be focused on
growing those metrics and

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.300
having momentum.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.610
Um, don&#39;t, don&#39;t let the
company get distracted or

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.250
excited by other things.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.620
Um, a common mistake is that
company&#39;s gets excited by

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.130
their own PR.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.970
It&#39;s really easy to get PR
with no results and

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.430
it feels like your actually
really cool.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.350
But in a year, you&#39;ll still
have nothing, and

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:31.880
at that point you won&#39;t be
cool anymore.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.750
And you&#39;ll just be

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.810
talking about these articles
from a year ago.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:36.520
That oh, you know, like
these Standford students

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.320
start this new startup, it&#39;s
gonna be the next big thing.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.840
And now you have nothing,
and that sucks.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.970
Um, and then,

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.730
as I mentioned already, be
in the same space.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.110
Ah, this is like,

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.640
I think this is pretty much
a non starter.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.700
Remote co-founding teams is
just really really hard.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.510
It slows down the cycle time
more

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.950
than anybody ever thinks
it&#39;s going to.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:02.090
The other piece, besides
focus for

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.050
execution is intensity.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.660
Um, startups only work at a
fairly intense level.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.170
Um, a friend of mine says
that the secret to startups

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.890
is extreme focus and extreme
dedication.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.300
You know you can like a have
a startup in one

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.320
other thing, you can have a
startup in a family but

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.380
you probably can&#39;t have many
other hobbies.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.980
Startups are not the best
choice for

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.400
work life balance.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.160
And that&#39;s sort of just, the
sad reality.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.760
Um, there&#39;s a lot of great
things about a startup, but

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.020
this is not one of them.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.100
Um, they are all consuming
in

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.330
a way that is difficult to
explain.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.250
You, you generally need to

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.770
be willing to outwork your
competitors.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.580
The good news here, uh, why
that&#39;s hard to see um, is

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.530
that a small amount of extra
work on the right thing.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:47.220
Makes a huge difference.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.540
One example that I like to
give is thinking about

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.700
the viral coefficient for a
consumer web product.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.110
Um, how many users how many
new users each

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.098
existing user brings in.

00:36:57.098 --> 00:36:59.550
If it&#39;s .99 the company will

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.600
eventually flatline and then
die.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.590
Uh, and if it&#39;s 1.01 you&#39;ll
be in this happy place of

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.390
exponential growth forever.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.230
Um, so this is just one
concrete example of where

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.150
a tiny bit of extra work is
the difference between

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:13.470
success and failure.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.760
And, when we talk to
successful founders they

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.110
tell stories like this all
the time.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.150
You know, just outworking
their competitors by

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:22.770
a little bit, was what made
them successful.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.530
Um, so you have to be really
intense, you know,

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:29.000
this only comes from the
CEO,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.750
this only comes from the
founders.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.090
Uh, one of the biggest
advantages that

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.450
startups have is execution
speed and

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.240
you have to have this
relentless operating rhythm.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.590
Um, Facebook has this famous
that says, move fast and

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.250
break things.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.300
Um, but at the same time,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.630
they manage to be obsessed
with quality.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:49.100
And this is why it&#39;s hard.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.280
It&#39;s easy to move fast or be
obsessed with quality.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.160
Um, the trick is

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.570
that you have to do both at
a start up.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.280
Um, you need to have a
culture where

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.520
people have very high
quality standards for

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.870
everything the company does
but still move quickly.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.800
Ah, Apple Facebook and

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.300
Google have all done this
extremely well.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.810
It&#39;s not just about the
product um,

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.200
it&#39;s about everything they
do.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.780
They move fast and they
break things and

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.520
they&#39;re frugal in the right
places.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.390
But they care about quality
everywhere.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.430
Um, you know you don&#39;t buy
people shitty computers if

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.110
you don&#39;t want them to write
shitty code.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.170
You really have to you do
have to

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.640
set a quality bar that runs
through the entire company.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.880
Related to this is that you
have to be decisive.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.550
Um, indecisiveness is a
start up killer.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.570
Mediocre founders spend a
lot of time talking about

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.930
grand plans but they never
quite make this decision.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.320
You know, they&#39;re, they&#39;re
talking about well I

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.580
could do this thing that
sounds great or

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.440
I could do this other thing.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.150
And they keep going back and
forth and they don&#39;t act.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:44.870
Now what you actually need
is this bias towards action.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.420
Um, the best founders work
on things that seem small,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.530
but they move really
quickly, uh,

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.270
they get things done really
quickly.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.560
Every time you talk to the
best founders, they,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.980
they&#39;ve got new things done.

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.280
In fact, this is the one
thing that we learned

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.120
best predicts success of
founders in YC.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.370
If every time we talk to a
team they&#39;ve gotten new

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.470
things done that&#39;s the best
predictor we have of

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.180
the company will go on to be
successful.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.910
Part of this is that you can
do huge things by,

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.490
in incremental pieces.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:19.620
If you just keep knocking
down

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.320
small chunks one at a time.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.610
In an year you look back
you&#39;ve done

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.300
this amazing thing.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.740
On the other hand if you
disappear for an year.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.030
And you expect to come back
with something amazing all

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.930
at once it usually never
happens.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.920
You have to pick these right
sized projects.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.880
You know even if you&#39;re
building this

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.910
crazy synthetic biology
company.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.640
Um, most people would say
well I have to go away for

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.970
an year, I can&#39;t do this
incrementally.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.378
There is almost always a way
to break it down,

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:45.030
into smaller projects.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.190
Um, so speed is this huge
premium, right?

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.200
The, the best founders
usually respond to email,

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.340
the most quickly.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.630
Um, they make decisions the
most quickly.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.450
They&#39;re generally quick in
all these different ways.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.020
Um, and they just have this
do

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.110
whatever it takes attitude.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.060
They also show up a lot.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.960
Um, they come to you know,
they come to

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.490
meetings they come in they
meet us in person.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.980
Um, one piece of advice uh,
that I have.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.160
It&#39;s always worked for me is
that they get on planes in

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.680
marginal situations.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.780
Um, how we doing on time?

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.130
I&#39;ll tell a quick story
here.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.330
Uh, when I was running my
own company um,

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:21.830
we found out that we were
about to lose a deal.

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.580
And it was sort of this,
this critical deal from

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.650
the first big customer in
the space.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:29.030
Uh, and it was gonna go to
this company that had

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.050
been around for years before
we were.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.480
Um, and they had us, like,
all locked up.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.220
So we called.
We said,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.070
hey we have this better
product.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.820
You gotta meet with us.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:36.520
They said, you know what.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.780
We&#39;re signing this deal
tomorrow.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.590
Sorry.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.220
Um, we drove to the airport.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.140
We got on a plane.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.050
Um, we were at their office
at 6AM the next morning.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:45.010
We just sat there.

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:45.980
They told us to go away.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.400
We just kept sitting there.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.110
Um, finally one of the
junior guys decided to

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.110
meet with us.

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.530
Um, finally after that,

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.590
one of the senior guys
decided to meet with us.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:54.680
They ended up ripping up the
contract and

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.560
sell their company.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.790
Um, and we closed the deal

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.390
with them about a week
later.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.290
Uh, and I&#39;m sure that had we
not gotten on a plane,

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.020
had we not shown up in
person,

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.710
that would not have worked
out.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.740
Um, and so you just sort of
like, you show up,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.380
you do these things, you
know.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.420
Uh, it&#39;s, when people say
get on planes in marginal

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.400
situations they usually mean
it.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.130
Uh, well they don&#39;t usually
mean it literally but

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.700
I think it&#39;s actually good
literal advice.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.040
Um, all right.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.570
&gt;&gt; Six minutes, so.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:24.830
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll skip that part then.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.840
So, I mentioned this
momentum and growth earlier.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.390
Uh, once more, that momentum
and

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.670
growth are the lifeblood of
startups.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.520
Um, this is the,

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.300
probably in the top three
secrets to executing well.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.390
You want a company to be
winning all the time.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.440
If you ever take your foot
off the gas pedal,

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.170
things will spiral out of
control, snowball downwards.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.930
Um, a winning team feels
good and keeps winning.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.190
A team that hasn&#39;t won in a
while gets demotivated and

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.720
keeps losing.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.530
So always keep momentum is
this prime directive for

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:00.770
managing a start up.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.950
Um, if I can only tell
founders one thing

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.990
about how to, how to run a
company, it would be this.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.770
For most start,

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:11.160
software startups, this
translates to keep growing.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.620
For hardware startups it
translates to don&#39;t let

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.190
your ship date slip.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.280
Um, this is what we tell
people during YC,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.260
and they usually listen,
everything is good.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.780
Um, what happens after the
end of YC is

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.160
that they get distracted on
other things.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.090
And then growth slows down.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.760
And somehow after that
happens,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.950
people start getting unhappy
and quitting and

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.330
then everything falls apart.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.780
It&#39;s hard to figure out

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.640
a growth engine because most
companies grow in new ways.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.550
Um, but there is this thing
about if you

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.260
built a good product, it
will grow.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.210
And so getting this good,
this product right at the

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.580
beginning is the best way to
not lose momentum later.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.640
If you do lose momentum,

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.400
most founders try to get it
back in the wrong way.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:57.300
They give these long
speeches about vision for

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:57.840
the company and

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.450
they try to rally the troops
with, with speeches.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.120
Um, but employees in a
company where momentum has

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.750
sagged don&#39;t wanna hear
that.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.180
Um, you have to save the
vision speeches for

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.010
when the company&#39;s winning.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:10.060
When you&#39;re not winning,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.820
you just have to get
momentum back in small wins.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.160
Um, a board member of mine
used to say that sales fix

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.170
everything in a startup, and
that is really true.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.790
So you figure out where you
can get these small wins,

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.310
and you get that done.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:22.330
And then you&#39;ll be amazed
how

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.950
all the other problems in a
startup disappear.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.170
Uh, another thing that
you&#39;ll notice if you

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:28.760
have momentum sag is that

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.670
everyone starts disagreeing
about what to do.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:33.300
Fights come out when a
company loses momentum.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.810
Uh, and so a framework for
that that I think works is.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.470
That when there&#39;s
disagreement among the team

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.830
about what to do, then you
ask your users and

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:43.960
you do whatever your users
tell you.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.590
And you have to remind
people like, hey, stuffs not

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.620
working right now we don&#39;t
actually hate each other.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.650
Um, we just need to get back
on track and

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:51.300
everything will work.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.910
And if you just call it out,
if you just acknowledge that

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.270
um, you&#39;ll find that things
will get way better.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.470
To use a Facebook example
again,

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.120
when Facebook&#39;s growth
slowed in 2008

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.090
Mark instituted a growth
group.

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:05.610
They worked on very small
things to

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.600
make Facebook real faster.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.330
Uh, all of these things by
themselves seemed really

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.130
small, but they got the, the
curve of Facebook back up.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.400
Um, it quickly became the
most

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.690
prestigious group there.

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.280
Um, Marcus said that it&#39;s
been one of

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.900
Facebook&#39;s best innovations.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.840
Um, according to friends of
mine that worked at

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.990
Facebook at the time.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.010
It really turned around the
dynamic of the company.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.370
And went from this thing
where everyone was

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.510
feeling bad and

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.790
the momentum was gone, back
to a place that was winning.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.270
So a good way to to keep
momentum is to

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:38.730
establish an operating
rhythm in the company early.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.020
Where you ship product and

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.220
lauch new features on this
regular basis.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:43.990
Uh, where you&#39;re reviewing
metrics you know,

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.790
every week with the entire
company.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:46.800
Uh, this is actually one of

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.068
the best things your board
can do for you.

00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:51.740
Um, boards add value to

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.810
business strategy only
rarely.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:54.540
Um, but

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.390
very frequently, you can use
them as a forcing function,

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.171
to get the company to care
about metrics,

00:44:59.171 --> 00:45:03.454
and milestones.

00:45:03.454 --> 00:45:05.750
Um, one thing that often
disrupts momentum and

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:08.920
really shouldn&#39;t is
competitors.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.130
Competitors making noise in
the press, I think,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.070
probably crushes a company&#39;s
momentum more often than

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:15.910
any other external factor.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.720
Um, so here&#39;s a good rule of
thumb.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.040
Don&#39;t worry about a
competitor at all.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.700
Um, until they&#39;re actually
leaving you with a real,

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.180
shipped product.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.080
Uh, press releases are
easier to write than code,

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:29.730
um, and that is still easier
than making a great product.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.800
So remind your company of
this, and don&#39;t, this is

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.480
sort of a founders rule, is
not to let the company get

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.340
down because of the
competitors and the press.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.130
Um, this great quote from
Henry Ford that I love.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:42.811
The competitor to be feared
is

00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:45.038
one who never bothers about
you at all.

00:45:45.038 --> 00:45:46.019
But goes on making his own

00:45:46.019 --> 00:45:47.900
business better all the
time.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.910
These are almost never the
companies that put out

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:53.660
a lot of press releases, and
they bum people out.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.640
Should we move on to this
section...

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.170
You know what, we&#39;ll cover
this in a later lecture.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.710
I will talk about, uh,

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.220
finance dealmaking and
distribution.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.165
Are there any questions?

00:46:06.987 --> 00:46:09.162
Okay, so on Tuesday, Paul
Graham is going to speak.

00:46:09.162 --> 00:46:09.875
See you then.

00:46:09.875 --> 00:46:10.770
Thank you.

WEBVTT

00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:02.841
Part two of Culture and
Team, and

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:05.708
we have Ben Silverman, the
founder of Pinterest, and

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.530
John and Patrick Collison,
the founders of Stripe.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.300
Founders that have obviously
sort of, some of the best in

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.190
the world at thinking about
culture and

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.940
how they build teams.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.400
So, there&#39;s three areas that
we&#39;re gonna cover today.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.690
One will just be sort of
general thoughts on

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.980
culture as a follow up to
the last lecture.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.580
And then we&#39;re really gonna
dig into what happens at

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.120
the founding of these
companies.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.790
And building out the early
team.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.530
And then how that changes
and evolves as these

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.940
guys have scaled their
companies up to 100 plus.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.270
I don&#39;t even know how many
people you have now,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.380
but quite a lot.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.520
Very large organizations and

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.240
how you adapt these
principles of culture.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.205
But to start off I just
wanna ask a very

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:47.970
open-ended question which
is,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.010
what are the core pieces of
culture that you found to

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.951
be most important in
building out your companies?

00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:56.720
&gt;&gt; So what are the most
important parts?

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.829
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s on.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it&#39;s on.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.769
Yeah I mean I think for

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.910
us, like we think about on a
few dimensions.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.780
One is like who do we hire,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.180
and what do those people
value?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.950
Two is what do we do every
day, like why do we do it?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.460
Three is what do we choose
to communicate?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.480
And then I think the fourth
is what we

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.460
choose to celebrate.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.220
I guess the converse of

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.590
that is like what you choose
to punish.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.880
But in general I think
running a company based on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.490
what you celebrate,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.360
is more exciting than what
you punish.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.040
But I think those four
things kind of make up

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.040
the bulk of it for us.

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:38.666
&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve placed a large
emphasis on, as Stripe has

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.536
grown and probably more than
other companies is,

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:43.560
transparency internally.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.940
And I think it&#39;s been
something that&#39;s been

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.505
really valuable for

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.460
Stripe, and also a little
bit misunderstood.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.740
All the things people talk
about like hiring really

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.070
great people, or giving them
a huge amount of leverage.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.220
Transparency for us plays
into that.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.335
We think that, if you are
aligned at a high

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:07.340
level about what Stripe is
doing, if everyone really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.078
believes in the mission, and
then if everyone has

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:14.639
really good access to
information, and kind of

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.401
has a good picture of the
current state of Stripe.

00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:21.175
Then that gets you a huge
amount of the way there in

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:24.230
terms of working
productively together.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.760
And it kind of forgives a
lot of the other things that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.790
tend to break as you, as you
grow a start-up.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.090
As we&#39;ve grown, we started
off two people.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.980
We&#39;re now over 170 people.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.160
We&#39;ve put a lot of thought
into the tooling that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.170
goes around transparency,
because at 170 people,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100
there is so much information
being produced,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.420
that you can&#39;t just consume
it all as a fire hose.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.300
And so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.820
how we use slack, how we use
email, things like that.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.030
We can go into it more
later.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.420
But I think that&#39;s one of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.060
the core things that&#39;s
helped us work well.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.180
&gt;&gt; I think culture to some
degree is basically kind of

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.790
the resolution to a
bandwidth problem.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
In the sense that, maybe
when you start out working

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.270
on something, you&#39;re sort of
coding all the time, but you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.580
can&#39;t code all the things
that you think the product

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.440
might need, or the company
might need, or whatever, and

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.150
you so you decide to work
with more coders, right?

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.870
And so the organization gets
larger.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.590
And maybe, in some idealized
world,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.750
I don&#39;t think this actually
true, but kind of ideally

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.950
you could be involved in
every single decision, and

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.370
every single sort of moment
of the company, and

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.820
everything that happens, but
obviously you can&#39;t, or

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.260
maybe you can if two people.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.440
But you certainly can&#39;t at
even like five or

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.530
ten kind of that point comes
very quickly,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.710
then by the time you&#39;re 50
it&#39;s completely hopeless.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.570
And so culture is kind of
how you kind of,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.110
what the strands are that
you sort of want to have,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.630
the invariance that you want
to kind of maintain,

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.840
as you can get specifically
involved in sort of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.338
fewer and fewer decisions
over time.

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:56.192
And I think when you think
about it that way it,

00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:59.680
maybe its kind of importance
becomes sort of

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.610
self evident, right?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.030
Because again, like the
fraction of things you

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.240
can be involved in directly
is diminishing, I mean,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.130
almost exponentially,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.430
sort of assuming your head
count growth sort of is

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.290
on a curve that looks like
one of the great companies.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.700
And yeah that&#39;s super
important.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.648
And again, it manifests
itself in a bunch of

00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:21.850
different ways.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.680
Like for example, in hiring,
I think a large part of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.810
the reason why maybe the
first ten people you hire,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.920
what kind of goes to ship,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.760
decisions are so important
is because you&#39;re not just

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.320
hiring those first ten
people.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.330
You&#39;re actually kind of
hiring 100 people.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.700
Because you should think of
kind of

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790
each one of those people as
bringing along sort of

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.580
another ten people with
them, and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.830
sort of figuring out exactly
what 90 people, you would

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.070
like those first ten people
to bring along is obviously

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.360
gonna be quite consequential
for your company.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.940
But really briefly I think
it&#39;s largely about sort of

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.020
abstraction.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.780
&gt;&gt; So one thing that a lot
of speakers in this

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.910
class have touched on is how
hiring those first ten

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.670
employees, if you don&#39;t get
that right,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.978
the company basically will
never recover but

00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:10.180
no one has talked about how
to do that so.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.000
What have the three of you
looked for

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.190
when you&#39;ve hired these
initial employees,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.800
to get the culture of the
company right?

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.835
How, how have you found
them, and

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:21.630
what have you looked for?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.610
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.542
I guess this answer is
different for every

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:32.640
company and I&#39;ll say for us
it was very inductive.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.390
So I literally looked for
people that I wanted to work

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.960
with and that I thought were
talented.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.960
I think, I&#39;ve read all these
books about culture,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.130
because when I don&#39;t know
how to do something,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.730
I first go read things and

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.920
everyone has all these
frameworks.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.090
And I think one bit, big
misconception that someone

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.270
said once is that people
think culture is like

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.480
architecture when it&#39;s a lot
more like gardening.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.650
You know, you plant some
seeds and

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.050
then you pull out weeds that
aren&#39;t working,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.570
and they sort of expand.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.650
So, when we first hired
people we hired people that

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.520
were like ourselves.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.030
I often looked at like three
or

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.460
four different things that I
really valued in people.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.700
You know, I looked for
people that worked hard and

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.890
seemed high integrity and
low ego.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.490
I looked for people that
were creative, and

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.170
I usually meant that they
were really curious.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.430
They had all these different
interests.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.120
Some of our first employees
are probably some of

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.280
the quirkiest people I&#39;ve
ever met.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.250
They were engineers but

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.540
they also have all these
crazy hobbies.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.390
Like one guy made his own
board game

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.240
with this elaborate set of
rules.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.240
Another guy was really into
magic tricks.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.210
And he had coded not only
like this magic trick on

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.000
the iPhone, but

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.290
he had shot the production
video with a preview.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.400
And I think that, that
quirkiness has actually been

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.390
a little bit of a calling
card.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.770
And we find that really
creative, quirky people that

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.710
are excited about many
disciplines, and are

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.720
extraordinary at one tend to
build really great products.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.220
They tend to be great at
collaborating.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.610
Then the last thing is, we
really look for

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:51.390
people that wanted to,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.180
they just wanted to build
something great, and

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.720
they weren&#39;t arrogant about
it, but they just felt like,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.190
it&#39;d be really cool to take
a risk and

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.530
build something bigger than
themselves.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:02.790
And that, in the beginning,
is very,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.250
very easy to select for if
you&#39;re in our situation.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.260
We had this horrible office,
like, nobody got paid.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.530
So there was no external
reason, other than being

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.810
excited about building
something to join.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.770
In fact, there was every
reason not to.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.410
And that&#39;s something,
looking back,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.170
I really, really value,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.080
because we always knew
people were joining for

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.275
the purest reasons, and in
fact,

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:23.680
were willing to forgo other
great job opportunities,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.190
market salary, a clean
office,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.540
good equipment just for the
chance to work.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.540
So, to this day I think a
lot of those traits have

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.230
been seeded and

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.050
are embedded in the folks
that we look at now.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah the first ten hires
are really

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.950
hard because you&#39;re making
these first ten

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.500
hires at a point where no
one&#39;s heard of this company,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.550
no one really wants to work
for it.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.530
You&#39;re just these,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.140
like two weird people
working on this weird idea.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.070
&gt;&gt; And like their friends
are telling them not

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.190
to join.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.320
For our second employee, I
think

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.800
he&#39;d accepted the offer or
he was just about to, and

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.700
his best friends took him
out the night before, and it

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.596
was like a full on assault
for, why you should not join

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:09.250
this company, why this is
ruining your life basically.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.720
And so anyway the guy
subsequently

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.750
continued to join.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:15.598
And actually one of

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:17.771
those friends also now works
at Stripe.

00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:20.067
But this is what you&#39;re up
against.

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:20.934
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:24.362
And I mean it&#39;s also hard
because no batch of

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:27.790
ten people will have as
great an influence on

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.630
the company as those first
ten people.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.640
I think everyone&#39;s
impression of recruiting is,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.430
you open LinkedIn.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.050
It&#39;s sort of like ordering
off the dollar menu.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.190
It&#39;s, I want that one, that
one, and that one.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.543
And, and now you have some
hires.

00:08:42.543 --> 00:08:46.606
Whereas at least for us, it
was very much over a very

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:50.103
long time period, talking
people we knew or

00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:53.780
friends of friends into
joining.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.880
We didn&#39;t have huge
networks, Pat and

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.100
I were both in college at
the time.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.630
So there were no people that

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.750
we&#39;d really worked with to
draw on, and so

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.280
a lot of those early Stripes
were people we had heard of,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.990
friends of friends, and the
other interesting thing they

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.665
all had in common is that
they were all

00:09:11.665 --> 00:09:16.400
early in their career, or
undervalued in some way.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.290
Cuz when you think about it,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.430
if someone is a known
spectacular quantity,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.570
then they&#39;re probably
working in a job and

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.730
very happy with that.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.720
And so we have to try and
find people who were,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.860
in the case of our designer
that we hired, he was 18 and

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.970
in high school and in Sweden
at the time.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:34.820
In the case of our,

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.040
our CTO, he was in college
at the time.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.030
You know, a lot of these
people,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.820
they were early on in their
careers and

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.920
the only way we could, you
can relax when constrained.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.940
You can relax the fact that
they&#39;re talented or

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.212
relax that it&#39;s apparent
that they&#39;re talented,

00:09:52.212 --> 00:09:56.240
and we, not consciously, but
we relaxed the latter.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think finding
kind of people who are, or

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.130
just think like a value
investor.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.170
You&#39;re looking for the human
capital that&#39;s

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.900
significantly devalued by
the market, you know?

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:12.940
You probably shouldn&#39;t look
to

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.850
hire your brilliant friends
at Facebook and Google or

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.050
whatever, because they&#39;re
already discovered.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.510
You know, if they&#39;re wanting
to join that&#39;s great,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.919
but they&#39;re probably harder
to convince.

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.570
John and I spent a little a
while yesterday

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.790
afternoon sort of trying to
figure out in retrospect,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.490
what kind of traits our
first ten or

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.320
so people had in common that
we thought were significant.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.711
And you know, in general
sort of in speaking about

00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:41.182
culture, I sort of want to
caveat everything we say

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:45.785
with, I that sort of advice
is very limited experience,

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:47.785
widely over extrapolated.

00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:50.690
And I think there&#39;s a lot of
truth to that.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.130
But for our particular first
ten people, the things we

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.350
sort of figured out that
seemed to be important were

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.760
they were also very genuine
and straight.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.900
I think that actually
matters quite a lot in that

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.880
sort of they&#39;re people that
sort of that others want to

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.120
work with, that they&#39;re
people that others trust.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.810
They sort of have an
intellectual honesty in

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:13.630
how they approach problems
and, and so forth.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.650
They were people who

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.490
really liked getting things
finished.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.290
There&#39;s a lot of people who

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.400
are really excited about
tons of things.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.630
Only a subset of those are
actually excited about like

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.970
completing things.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.160
You know, there&#39;s a lot of
talk about, for

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.940
example hiring people off
their GitHub resumes,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.140
whatever, actually think
that doesn&#39;t quite ring,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.620
kind of correct to me.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.520
In the sense that place is a
large premium on sort of

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.680
lots of different things.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.210
I think it&#39;s actually a
priori,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.630
sort of much more
interesting to work with

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.750
someone who has spent two
years really investing in

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.882
going deep in a particular
area.

00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:49.670
And then the third trait
they all seem to have in

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.460
common is they just sort of
cared a great deal.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.300
Like, it was offensive to
them when something was

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.670
just a little bit off.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.670
And kind of again,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.590
in hindsight, there are all
these like crazy things we

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.010
used to do that I mean, do
in fact seem crazy like we

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.470
probably shouldn&#39;t have done
them,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.620
but everyone was always like
well, was borderline insane

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.740
in sort of how much they
cared about tiny details.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:16.340
Like we used to, like every
single API request that

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.540
ever generated an error went
to all of our inboxes and

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.760
phoned all of us.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.830
Because it seems terrible to
ever have an error that

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120
didn&#39;t go and

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.650
get a resolution from the
user standpoint.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.440
Or we used to like copy
everyone else on

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.850
every outgoing email.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.030
And we&#39;d like point out
slight grammar or

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.070
spelling mistakes to each
other, because it&#39;s terrible

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.910
to ever send an email with a
spelling mistake.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.890
So anyway those were the
three traits come

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.660
from that area.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.466
A genuine, caring a great
deal.

00:12:46.466 --> 00:12:51.471
And, so what was my second
one?

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.105
&gt;&gt; The other one.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:55.442
&gt;&gt; Yeah so.

00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:58.903
Sorry yes completing things
like list of three items.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#39;m only gonna say
I just don&#39;t think

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.410
there&#39;s any wrong place to
find people, so when I

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.080
look back at our first few
folks that we hired.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.090
They came from all over the
place.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.159
Like I put up ads on
Craigslist.

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:14.162
I went to random tech talks.

00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:15.642
You know, we met people at,

00:13:15.642 --> 00:13:18.190
we used to throw weekly
barbeques at the office.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.490
It was like bring your own
food and drinks.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.070
And then we would just talk
to folks.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.360
I think every time I ever
went and

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.330
got coffee in Palo Alto.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.060
Like one of you guys was
recruiting at

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.570
Coopa because their office
was like

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.605
strategically situated next
to the best coffee shop.

00:13:32.605 --> 00:13:36.050
But I think that the really
good people generally,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.390
they&#39;re generally doing
something else, and

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.910
so you have to go seek them
out,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.394
rather than expecting that
they&#39;re gonna seek you out.

00:13:42.394 --> 00:13:45.000
Triple so, when no one&#39;s
ever heard of or

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.301
is using the product that
you&#39;re working on.

00:13:47.301 --> 00:13:52.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah it&#39;s probably really
important to

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.140
have a great elevator pitch.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.847
Not even for investors, but

00:13:56.847 --> 00:13:59.979
just because everyone you
run into right now is maybe

00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:03.730
six months, a year down the
road, a potential recruit.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.280
And so, the right time to
have gotten them

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.200
excited about your company,
the right time for

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.620
them to have started
following us,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.820
and be thinking about it if
they think about what

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.900
they&#39;re going to do next, is
as soon as you can start.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.220
It&#39;s gonna take a very long
time to recruit people so to

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.190
being able to consistently
get people excited about

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.330
what you&#39;re doing will pay
back dividends later.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.190
&gt;&gt; Maybe this is a little
tangential but John and

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.920
I were also chatting
yesterday afternoon sort of

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.850
like a bunch of our friends
have sort of

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.862
started companies right out
of school.

00:14:33.862 --> 00:14:35.660
We were sort of thinking
about,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.785
what seems to go wrong in
those companies.

00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:39.685
And I think something,

00:14:39.685 --> 00:14:43.010
that may be the most common
failure mode.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.680
Since we said of doing
something kind of

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.940
overly niche, or overly sort
of specific and banded.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.250
I think maybe it comes from
sort of like there&#39;s a major

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.930
shift in time horizon.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.327
As you go from classes to
building a start-up.

00:14:54.327 --> 00:14:55.543
Right?
A class kind of plays out in

00:14:55.543 --> 00:14:57.193
a quarter or a semester or
whatever.

00:14:57.193 --> 00:15:00.116
Whereas a start-up is like a
five or ten year thing.

00:15:00.116 --> 00:15:03.163
And I think this is really
problematic because it&#39;s

00:15:03.163 --> 00:15:05.379
actually quite hard to hire
people for

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:08.009
niche things, in that if you
tell somebody,

00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:11.290
look we&#39;re going to build a
rocket that goes to Mars.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.170
Like I mean that sounds
almost impossible, but

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.470
also sounds fucking awesome.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.680
Right?
And so it&#39;s actually pretty

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.730
easy to convince people to
work on it.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.740
Of course, if it&#39;s well, you
know,

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.050
we&#39;re going to build this, I
don&#39;t wanna single out any

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.710
particular idea, because
probably sound like I&#39;m

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.090
picking some actual start up
that&#39;s doing it.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.740
But you know, if you pick
something pretty narrow,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.010
something that maybe kind of
inductively comes out of

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.450
the kinds of problems you
solve as part of a class

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.370
project, that&#39;s actually a
much harder effort.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.410
&gt;&gt; One specific question
that has come up a lot is,

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.630
how as a relatively
inexperienced founder do

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.980
you identify who the really
great people are?

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.770
So, you know, you meet
people at these barbecues or

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.860
for your friends or
whatever, and

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.970
maybe you&#39;ve worked with
them a little bit.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.480
But what specifically did,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.350
did you guys do in your
processes to identify like,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.180
you know, what this person&#39;s
going to be really great?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.550
Or when did you really get
it wrong?

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.950
But what have you learned
about how to

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.670
identify raw talent if you
can&#39;t just say, well they

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.270
worked at Google or
Facebook, they must be good?

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.550
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, you&#39;ll
never

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.272
like 100% know obviously
until you work with folks.

00:16:07.272 --> 00:16:09.260
Which is why the flip side
of it is, you know,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.210
if someone you hired just
wasn&#39;t a good fit,

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.550
you owe it to the company
and

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.650
to them, to tell them how
they can improve, and

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.060
if they&#39;re not working out
to fire them.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.207
But I think that the
generally,

00:16:19.207 --> 00:16:21.350
the question of talent falls
into two big buckets.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.320
Like, one is you have some
sense of

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.340
what makes them good at
their job, and

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.560
there are some areas where
you have taste in that area,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.080
and there&#39;s some where you
don&#39;t.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.780
And the ones where you

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.289
don&#39;t are actually much more
difficult.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.160
So what we would do is, is
we would do a few things.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.700
Like first,

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.650
before talking to anyone we
try to get a sense for like

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.290
what is really world class
in that discipline mean.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.810
And this becomes very
important later,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.140
when you&#39;re hiring things
like Head of Finance and

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.850
you don&#39;t anything about
finance.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.930
Except what was contained in
like a library book you

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.800
got about like an
introduction to finance,

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.295
or head of marketing.

00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:56.420
So, I always made it a habit
of, like, talking to

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.510
people that I knew de facto
were world class and

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.020
then asking them,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.890
specifically, what are the
key traits or

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.030
characteristics that you
look for?

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.170
What are the questions that
you ask, and

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.820
how do you find them?

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.810
And if you&#39;re looking for

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.320
the next person that&#39;s as
good as you, like,

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.700
where are, where is that
person working right now,

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.290
and, like, what&#39;s, what&#39;s
her phone number?

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.280
I think that, like, learning
what good and bad is during

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.330
the interview process, is
extremely expensive.

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.580
It&#39;s an expensive use of
your time, and

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.140
it&#39;s an expensive use of
everyone else&#39;s time,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.460
so precalibration of that
really matters.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.950
And then, once you have
someone in, sort of,

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.470
the interview process,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.012
you&#39;ll build the process
over time,

00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:33.380
to both screen quality.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.640
And so at Pinterest, you
know, we have

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.520
an evolving set of standard
questions that we&#39;re

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.440
always rotating through, and
we&#39;re always measuring,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.360
are these good indicators or
bad indicators of quality?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.900
But the other thing that the
questions are meant to do,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.710
is they&#39;re supposed to give
a sense for,

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.740
is this the right place for

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.220
that person to come and
work?

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.800
And this to the point you
guys made about being very

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.250
transparent about what&#39;s
gonna be easy or hard.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.460
Really great people wanna do
things that are hard,

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.530
they wanna solve tough
problems.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.560
And so, there was a certain
brilliance in

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.250
Google setting out these
interview questions that

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.410
were thought to be really
difficult.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:06.250
Because then people who like
solving really

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.280
difficult problems, they
come out and seek those.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.780
I think it&#39;s really
important,

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.880
even as companies get
bigger,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.870
that you don&#39;t whitewash the
risks.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.120
I heard that PayPal, you&#39;d
go in and

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.940
after interviewing with like
Peter Thiel and

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.780
Max Levchin, then they would
say by the way like Visa and

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.920
MasterCard wanna kill us,
and

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.140
we might be doing something
that&#39;s illegal.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.220
But if you succeed, you&#39;ll
redefine payments.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.410
Or when they were recruiting
for iPhone,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.906
they didn&#39;t even tell people
what they were doing.

00:18:31.906 --> 00:18:34.927
They were like you won&#39;t see
your families for

00:18:34.927 --> 00:18:37.408
three years, but when you&#39;re
done,

00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.970
your kid&#39;s kids will
remember what you built.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.890
And I think that&#39;s a really
good thing in recruiting as

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.100
well that you&#39;re very
transparent about why you

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.950
think it&#39;s an amazing
opportunity, but

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.000
you lay out in gory detail
why it&#39;s gonna be hard.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.090
And then the right people
select in, or

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.580
they select out of that
opportunity.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.010
&gt;&gt; Evidence suggest it&#39;s
worth a lot of

00:18:59.010 --> 00:18:59.980
people to see their kids,
though.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.610
I feel like one thing you
have to do as you try to

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:12.340
identify talent is have the
confidence to interview for,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.922
in a way that works for you.

00:19:13.922 --> 00:19:17.412
I think you know, if you&#39;re,
say you&#39;re not,

00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:19.410
the world&#39;s best engineer
and

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.850
you&#39;re trying to interview
engineering candidates.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.220
I think it&#39;s tempting to try
to

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.880
color code what everyone
else does.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.320
And you know, get them to
call it on white board.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.750
And do other engineering,
interviewee things.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.140
You know in the case of
Stripe,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.990
hiring our first engineer.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.730
We flew the guy out, and we
spent a weekend coding with

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.760
him, and you know looked
over his shoulder and

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.830
kind of, it was the only way
we could really tell and

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.070
get ourselves confident
that, that person was good.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.720
And I think you can actually
extend that to other roles,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.310
where again you&#39;re not an
expert, and

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.500
that you know I&#39;m no
business development guru.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.170
But when we interview people
for

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.360
business development roles,

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.962
we&#39;ll ask them to do a
project, you know?

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:58.780
Where they talk about how
they would

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.080
improve an existing
partnership that Stripe has.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.810
Or which new partnerships
they would go out and do.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.140
And again, you know,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.520
even though it&#39;s not my
domain area, I am actually

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.390
confident enough that I can
judge those pretty well.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.160
And I think people often
have this imposter syndrome

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.580
when it comes to
interviewing for roles.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.135
Yeah.
I think a pretty specific,

00:20:16.135 --> 00:20:18.483
just kind of just tactical
thing, and to do for

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:21.313
again the first 10 people,
is to work with them as much

00:20:21.313 --> 00:20:23.620
as you can before committing
to hiring them.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.370
I mean, once you

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.070
reach a certain scale it&#39;s
kind of impractical,

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.700
because it&#39;s a huge time
commitment on their side.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.630
And ultimately I mean it
just would be unskilled,

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.590
would be expensive from your
side.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.210
But it&#39;s really worth it

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.330
to get the first ten people
right.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.180
And so, for

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.120
a majority, maybe in all of
the first ten people,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.680
we worked with them in some
capacity.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.480
Usually for a week in
advance, and

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.777
it&#39;s pretty hard to fake it
for a week.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.020
It tends to be pretty clear,
quite quickly.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.840
And another thing I thought
of you know, to the question

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.830
of sort of how do you know
like who is great or

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.870
who is good enough or
whatever.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.740
And people always talk about
this notion of

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.350
the ten x person, that
whatever that skill set is.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.210
I don&#39;t really know what ten
x means,

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.550
I think maybe the slightly
more kind of helpful or like

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.180
intuitive version of that
is, is this person probably,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.090
the best out of all of their
friends at what they do.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.600
And so you know, it&#39;s a
little bit sensitive to you

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.290
know, how well they chose
friends, how many they have.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.150
But for me at least, I find
that kind of

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.550
a more helpful way to think
about it, like

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.209
is this the best engineer
this engineer knows.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.230
And the other thing I

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.570
think that&#39;s actually
probably just worth

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.320
mentioning in all of those
kind of first ten people, or

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.550
even more generally on the
culture and hiring topic.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.650
I think everyone sort of
doesn&#39;t realize until they

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.620
go through it themselves how
it important it is,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.210
in large part because the,
like in life and the media

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.580
and everything, people focus
way too much on founders.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.780
And they&#39;re like, here we
are.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:44.430
And so kind of,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.760
we&#39;re re-enforcing the sort
of structural narrative that

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.660
like, stripe is about John
and Patrick.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.510
And Pinterest is about Ben
and so forth.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:51.830
Whereas, I mean, obviously,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.320
sort of the vast majority of
what our companies do

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.860
like 99.9% is being down by
people who are not us.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.490
Right?

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.930
And I think, I mean, that&#39;s
kind of,

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.410
it&#39;s obvious when you say
it, but it&#39;s at a very much,

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.840
not just the macro narrative
and

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.970
you know, companies are
abstract.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.670
So you kind of need to
associate them with people.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.230
But I think it&#39;s worth
bearing in mind that like

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.010
for, you know, Apple, you
know everything was

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.840
you know, Steve Jobs was a
like tiny, tiny detail at

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.240
the end, right, or Google
was that way, and so forth.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.590
&gt;&gt; So don&#39;t screw it up, is
that what you&#39;re saying?

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.430
&gt;&gt; Something like that.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.870
&gt;&gt; I think, you know, one
other thing I&#39;ll mention is

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.360
that I think referencing
people is really important,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.270
and referencing people is
just what it sounds like.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.780
You&#39;re basically asking
people who have real,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.890
material working experience,
for their honest opinion.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.220
And we do that really
aggressively, and

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:38.740
what we&#39;re trying to

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.900
figure out is what&#39;s this
person like to work with?

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.070
We&#39;re not trying to validate
like whether they

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.260
told the truth on their
resume,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.400
cuz we assume that they&#39;re
telling the truth.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.740
So, very standard questions
that I&#39;ll ask somebody who&#39;s

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.460
in an interview, I might
say, hey,

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.500
we both know Jonathan in
common.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.240
I&#39;m gonna talk to him, you
know,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.090
in a couple weeks, cause
we&#39;re both social friends.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.560
Like if I asked him, what
you&#39;re the best at, or

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.690
what you would be most proud
of, or

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.230
what you were kind of
working to improve.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.770
What would he or she say?

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.760
Because it sort of tests the
level of self awareness, and

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.900
creates a bit of social
accountability.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.550
And then I&#39;ll try to ask
something that makes the

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.170
question which is typically
very soft feel a little bit

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.300
more quantitative, and then
calibrate that over time.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.890
So you know,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.680
in evaluating this person or
this dimension, do you think

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.110
this is the top 1% of people
you&#39;ve ever worked with?

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.090
The top 5% and the top 10%?

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.410
And it forces a scarcity
that gives a materially

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.110
different reference, then if
you just say hey,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.060
like what&#39;s the best thing
about John?

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.680
He told me you know, he&#39;s
good at these things.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.250
Can you validate?

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:38.840
And you&#39;re like yeah,

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.220
sure, Cuz they don&#39;t gain
anything.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.132
So I think that&#39;s just a
tool that people should

00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:43.920
take seriously.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.559
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:44.559 --> 00:23:45.149
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:48.168
referencing isn&#39;t obviously
easy to begin with, but

00:23:48.168 --> 00:23:51.400
it does actually prove
really useful over time.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.160
And you just have to, people
I think especially for

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.350
named references, people
really want to be nice.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.370
So you have to do things
like create an artificial

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.600
scarcity by saying you know,
where would you rank this

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.230
person amongst the people
you worked within this role?

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.780
Or, you know,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.730
you just splitz out on the
enchant of how to reference,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.630
but usually I aim to spend,
you know,

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.470
15 minutes on the phone with
that person.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.520
Not just let them say, yeah
this person is awesome, and

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.720
then hang up.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.190
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s also a tremendous
source of new recruits.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.530
&gt;&gt; Those references are also
a tremendous source of

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.120
new recruits.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.690
What have each of you
learned about,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.770
once you hire these first
people and they joined?

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.300
What have you done to make
them effective quickly?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.280
To get them sort of, you
know,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.190
to the right cultural place,
you know?

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.600
Cuz sort of hiring is
usually very difficult, but

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.430
then not as difficult as
making them

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.150
happy and effective.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:39.860
So what do you do

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.500
with these early employees
to accomplish that?

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.860
&gt;&gt; Well, ways that it&#39;s
changed when we&#39;ve gone from

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.790
really small to bigger.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.800
When we first started,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.970
we were generally hiring
because we needed

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.700
that person, like, a long
time ago.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.090
And so their whole
on-boarding was like,

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:57.690
here&#39;s your computer,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.880
we already set up your
environment,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.500
don&#39;t worry about it,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.690
this is the problem that we
have to solve together.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:04.810
And then because of the
nature of the start ups,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.380
we were all in this, like,
tiny, two bedroom apartment.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:09.760
All of the other things,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.250
like building personal
relationships,

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:12.680
spending time together,
getting to know one another,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.810
it just all happened.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.990
Kind of automatically like,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.145
you didn&#39;t have to do
anything.

00:25:16.145 --> 00:25:19.730
The one thing that I would
add to that is, though,

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.420
we would always try to
remind people of like,

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.600
where we wanted to go some
day.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.370
Cuz it&#39;s really easy when
you first join to drop

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.380
somebody into a problem, and
then they think the whole

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.520
world is like this little
problem in front of them.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.080
We&#39;d always say,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.320
you know, hey, some day we
wanna do for

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.830
Discovery what Google did
for search.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.300
This is our plan for trying
to get that done.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.690
Now as the company, grows I
think that process has to

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.300
get a little bit more
formalized.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.660
And so we spend a lot of
time thinking, and honestly

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.770
trying to constantly refine
what is that person&#39;s

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.560
experience look like from
the day they came in,

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.240
to their very first
interview,

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.960
through 30 days after they
joined.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.590
Like do they have somebody
whose name they know?

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.730
Do they know who their
manager is?

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.100
Have they sat down with
people on their team?

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.070
Do they know what the
general architecture of

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.700
the company is, and what the
top priorities are?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.390
And we have a program and
it&#39;s a week long, and

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.370
then there are some function
specific programs that

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.740
go in deeper.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.638
And that&#39;s something that&#39;s
always been refined.

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:15.190
And the alpha metrics that
we look on that,

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.400
it&#39;s when we ask people like
what did you think

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.090
afterwards and then 30 days
afterwards.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.030
And then we also ask their
peers and their manager,

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.330
like hey, is this person
kind of up to speed?

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.090
Do you feel like we&#39;ve done

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.290
a good job making them
productive?

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.330
And if we haven&#39;t, that&#39;s a
key A, that, that team

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.760
shouldn&#39;t be hiring anymore
people, because they&#39;re not

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.720
doing a good job bringing in
new people.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.655
And B, that we need to
retool that.

00:26:35.655 --> 00:26:37.520
And so I think those things
are important.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.450
I just wouldn&#39;t discount
just how important it is to

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.380
get to know the person as a
person.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.840
Like what are their
aspirations?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.730
What&#39;s their working style?

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.250
How do they like to be
recognized?

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.810
Do they really prefer being
in total silence?

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.070
Are they a morning person or
night person?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.400
Like knowing those things I
think, it just

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.270
demonstrates that you care
about them individually as

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.320
well as collectively, like
what you goals are.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.540
&gt;&gt; I think there are two
things that are important at

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.680
any stage through the
implementation of a change.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.330
The first is to get them up
and

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.480
running, doing real work
quickly.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.560
Because that&#39;s only when you
can find the problems,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.110
that&#39;s how progress is
measured,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.340
is how much real work
they&#39;re doing.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.000
And so, you know, when we
have engineers start,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.800
we&#39;ll try to get them
committing on the first day.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.620
When we have people you
know,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.150
people in business roles
start,

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.750
we will have them in real
meetings on the first day,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.390
on what they&#39;re meant to be
working on.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.260
But I think sometimes
there&#39;s a tendency to

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.430
be tentative, and help ease
people in.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.930
We&#39;re much more of the push
people off the cliff school.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.820
And then I think the second,
is to try and

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.690
start quickly giving people
feedback, and

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.710
especially feedback on how
to adapt to the culture.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.020
Because when you think about
it, like, you know,

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:49.490
if you have built a strong
culture as, you know,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.310
all the companies up here
are trying to,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:55.080
then it&#39;s going to take some
adapting for the person.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.210
It&#39;s not going to be
necessarily easy, you know?

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.150
One thing we have at Stripe,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.210
is just the culture was a
lot more written.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:03.050
And so, you know?

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.480
You have people who are
right next to

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.790
each other each with
headphones on, and

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.360
just like IM&#39;ing away to
each other.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.170
And for you know,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.490
a lot of people coming in
who hadn&#39;t worked in

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.210
an environment like that,
it&#39;s, it&#39;s sort of hard.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.050
&gt;&gt; In normal places.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:12.680
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
Yeah.

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.520
And so, everything from kind
of high level how you&#39;re

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.780
doing at your job, to kind
of minor cultural pointers.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.530
The more feedback you can
give them,

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:23.440
the better they&#39;ll do.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.150
And it&#39;s unnatural.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:24.660
Right?
Because it&#39;s

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.850
unnatural to be constantly
telling people that

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:28.980
they&#39;re doing a good or bad
job.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.870
You don&#39;t do that,
hopefully,

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.210
in your normal life, you&#39;re
more restrained.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:35.570
But when you have employees,

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.470
that&#39;s kind of what you owe
them for them to do well.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.170
&gt;&gt; So I think this is sort
of a good transition too,

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.609
as your companies have
scaled.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.420
What are the biggest changes
you&#39;ve had to make to your

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.560
hiring processes?

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.140
And also how you sort of
manage and

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.020
run the team, as you&#39;ve gone
from, you know,

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.980
two to 10 to 100 to 1000
employees?

00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.950
&gt;&gt; There a lot of changes.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.550
I mean, I think one thing
that we try to do on

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:07.040
the team side is, the goal
is to make the teams feel as

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.130
autonomous and nimble as
possible within

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.140
the constraints of having a
large organization.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.020
And that means over time,
that we&#39;re always trying to

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.430
make it feel like a start-up
of of many start-ups,

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.690
rather than this monolithic
organization with a set of

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.170
foreign processes that cut
horizontally through it.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.290
And it&#39;s easier said than
done.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.280
I think that, like we&#39;re not
all the way there.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.830
But one of our goals is that
each team has, they control

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.772
the resources that they need
to get things done,

00:29:29.772 --> 00:29:32.960
they know what the most
important thing is, and

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.150
how it&#39;s measured.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:35.320
And in that way,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.490
then the management problem
becomes somewhat tractable,

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.410
otherwise it feels
completely impossible if

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.610
you can&#39;t decompose it into
autonomous units.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.609
Like you just look at it,
and you&#39;re like, oh my gosh,

00:29:43.609 --> 00:29:45.752
communication complexity is
increasing geometrically.

00:29:45.752 --> 00:29:46.810
Management complexity,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.250
like it&#39;s never gonna work,
and so

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.411
you have to sort of create
these abstracted units, or

00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:52.247
that&#39;s at least what we&#39;re
gonna try to do.

00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:54.741
And at Pinterest in
particular, the real

00:29:54.741 --> 00:29:57.811
challenge of creating those
abstracted units is.

00:29:57.811 --> 00:29:59.296
We want to actually have

00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:02.419
units that encompass a
super-strong designer,

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:06.060
a super-strong leader in
engineering, often a writer,

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.830
often sometimes like a
community manager.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.890
We want them all to be
self-contained.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.190
And so that makes the
problem really hard,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.860
but that&#39;s kind of core to
our philosophy of how we

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.480
build products.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.560
We try to put people
together that have all of

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.520
these different disciplines.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.056
They&#39;re curious about lots
of things.

00:30:20.056 --> 00:30:21.680
And then we anchor them on a
single project and then we

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.115
try to remove barriers to
let them go fast.

00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:25.940
When we find new barriers,
we sit down and

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.180
we think, how do we speed
that up?

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.850
I think hiring is a little
bit different.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:33.710
And I think the biggest
change and

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.200
the biggest asset that you
get as you get more

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.890
people is referrals become
like more and more and

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.660
more and more the life blood
depending on

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.998
the network of all the
people that you bring in.

00:30:41.998 --> 00:30:43.380
So one of the really lucky,

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.087
and in hindsight, great
decisions that we made, was

00:30:46.087 --> 00:30:48.794
actually the 14th or 15th
person that we hired was

00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:51.888
a professional recruiter and
she had worked at start-ups.

00:30:51.888 --> 00:30:54.580
She had worked at big
companies like Apple.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.672
But she knew where that
pipeline breaks down,

00:30:57.672 --> 00:30:59.812
knew the early indicators,
and

00:30:59.812 --> 00:31:03.460
taught everyone not just how
to screen for talent, but

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.949
how scalably to identify the
people that are gonna be

00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:09.900
culturally, really good for
the company.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.076
And I think looking back on
that,

00:31:12.076 --> 00:31:15.350
it&#39;s something that I
personally really value.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.894
&gt;&gt; You know, there&#39;s just a
huge amount of

00:31:17.894 --> 00:31:18.495
stuff here, right?

00:31:18.495 --> 00:31:19.632
In that I guess,

00:31:19.632 --> 00:31:23.408
this is all under kinda the
rubric of managing growth.

00:31:23.408 --> 00:31:27.737
And either your company
fails very quickly or all of

00:31:27.737 --> 00:31:31.210
your problems become in some
way about managing growth.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.030
One thing that I think tends
to take people by surprise,

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.550
and certainly took me by
surprise,

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.330
is kind of how quickly just
like the time

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.370
horizon has changed.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.720
In that, in your first month
you&#39;re largely thinking

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.660
about things maybe one month
ahead, right?

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.168
In that, maybe that&#39;s kind
of

00:31:50.168 --> 00:31:52.721
what your development road
map is oriented around,

00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:54.820
even in terms of who you&#39;re
working with.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.370
Maybe it&#39;s like,

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.280
informal relationships where
they haven&#39;t fully committed

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.160
to remain full time or
whatever, right?

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.372
And then, the more time goes
by,

00:32:02.372 --> 00:32:05.058
I think that kind of has a
reciprocal, or

00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:08.220
corresponding increase in
the time horizons.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.920
After one year, you&#39;re kind
of thinking one year ahead.

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.675
After four years, you&#39;re
thinking four years ahead.

00:32:13.675 --> 00:32:16.870
But that increases very
quickly, right?

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:17.879
And so after you know,

00:32:17.879 --> 00:32:20.440
it&#39;s after one month, it&#39;s
again, super short term.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.180
And then just 11 months
later you should now

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.650
actually be thinking and
planning a year ahead, and

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.250
thinking about human
structures on

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.162
that time horizon.

00:32:28.162 --> 00:32:31.315
Thinking about the stuff Ben
talked about, like where you

00:32:31.315 --> 00:32:34.530
want to be going long term
and things like that.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.773
I think that also plays into
your hiring and

00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:38.775
the kinds of people you
hire, right?

00:32:38.775 --> 00:32:40.499
In that in the really early
days you kind of

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:42.322
have to hire people who will
be productive,

00:32:42.322 --> 00:32:43.520
essentially immediately.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.812
You don&#39;t have the luxury of
hiring people who are really

00:32:47.812 --> 00:32:50.496
promising, but they&#39;re not
quite gonna be up to

00:32:50.496 --> 00:32:52.420
speed for another year or
two.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.090
They have to be able to
contribute immediately.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.330
But after two or three
years, now it starts to get

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.550
much more reasonable to make
those investments and

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.110
in fact, if you&#39;re not
making those investments,

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.380
you&#39;re probably being much
too short term.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.060
And so I think that&#39;s really
important.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.880
And a lot of it also just
comes from

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.355
all these problems in some
sense are easy,

00:33:11.355 --> 00:33:14.240
like how do you build good
social bonds between people?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.795
I mean, we all do it every
day, right?

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:21.355
It&#39;s kind of, how do you
make it systematic and

00:33:21.355 --> 00:33:22.968
effective at scale?

00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:26.597
It&#39;s always a very severely
imperfect approximation of

00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:29.620
what you would ideally do if
you were small, and

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.566
what hacks can you pull to
make it work as well as

00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:35.460
you possibly can at a larger
scale.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.804
Like a rapidly growing
company,

00:33:36.804 --> 00:33:38.244
say growing headcount here,
two or

00:33:38.244 --> 00:33:40.412
three x a year, it is a very
unnatural thing.

00:33:40.412 --> 00:33:43.327
And so it&#39;s, what&#39;s the
least bad way of sort of

00:33:43.327 --> 00:33:45.370
managing that period of
growth?

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.620
Human organizations aren&#39;t
designed for

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:52.240
it and I think it&#39;s worth
being quite systematic about

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.360
thinking about ways to do
that.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.650
But realizing that you
probably can&#39;t do

00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.420
much better than adequation.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.464
You know, for Stripe, it&#39;s
things like we

00:34:01.464 --> 00:34:03.120
have three meals every day
at sort of

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.008
long tables where everyone
can sit together, right?

00:34:06.008 --> 00:34:09.190
And if you think of net, how
much more total human

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.169
interaction happens as a
result of having these kind

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:15.233
of randomly mixed meals,
it&#39;s vast, right?

00:34:15.233 --> 00:34:17.900
And it&#39;s kind of a whole
list of things like that.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.260
But, I think that&#39;s kind of
the general framework.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.500
&gt;&gt; One thing I&#39;m really
curious about you guys value

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.053
transparency.

00:34:24.053 --> 00:34:26.577
How have you scaled it over
time?

00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:28.320
I know we think about
figuring it out all

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.318
the time, just curious.

00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:33.404
&gt;&gt; So you know, start-ups, I
can&#39;t remember who it was,

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:37.576
defined it as a, start-up is
an organization that&#39;s not

00:34:37.576 --> 00:34:41.510
yet stuck with all of these
principle agent problems.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.616
That at most large
companies,

00:34:43.616 --> 00:34:47.261
what is locally optimal for
you is very frequently not

00:34:47.261 --> 00:34:50.204
what is globally optimal for
the company.

00:34:50.204 --> 00:34:56.850
And so there are, as a
consequence of that,

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.480
probably a lot of ways in
which a start-up can

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.270
work differently to a big
company.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.130
At a big company, a lot of
the things that are good for

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.460
you, well, you couldn&#39;t do
them in

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.640
a completely transparent
environment, right?

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.350
Because people would think
less of you or

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.180
you&#39;re doing things you&#39;re
not supposed to.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.005
But because everyone is kind
of sailing in the, or

00:35:15.005 --> 00:35:16.916
rowing in the same direction
at a start-up, you can

00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:19.022
actually just make all of
the information transparent.

00:35:19.022 --> 00:35:23.369
And so, I guess I mentioned
earlier, Stripe used to BCC

00:35:23.369 --> 00:35:27.626
every other person at Stripe
on basically every single

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:31.789
outgoing email unless you
opted out of it, because we

00:35:31.789 --> 00:35:35.230
thought that would be much
more efficient.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.470
You wouldn&#39;t need to have as
many meetings,

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.370
if you just kind of keep
abreast of what&#39;s happening.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.590
And over time we&#39;ve sort of
built an increasingly

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.700
intricate framework of
mailing lists and

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.680
we now have a program for
generating Gmail filters.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.390
And for like a pretty rocky
patch where 50 people or

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.840
so, to Ben&#39;s point of like,
asking people how they&#39;re

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.380
getting on after the first
couple of days.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.671
They&#39;re reported terribly
because like they couldn&#39;t

00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:00.722
even find all the emails
that people were sending to

00:36:00.722 --> 00:36:03.710
them and they were missing
things and everything.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.080
&gt;&gt; Gmail broke at one stage.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.584
&gt;&gt; Oh, right, at one point
Gmail broke because we

00:36:06.584 --> 00:36:07.838
were just like sending too
much email.

00:36:07.838 --> 00:36:10.804
It is hard to scale, because
I mean,

00:36:10.804 --> 00:36:15.210
you might contact somebody
outside of the company with

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.657
like some great idea, and
maybe the person

00:36:18.657 --> 00:36:22.776
sitting across the way from
you thinks that&#39;s like

00:36:22.776 --> 00:36:26.818
the stupidest idea they&#39;ve
ever heard, right?

00:36:26.818 --> 00:36:29.124
And you&#39;re kind of subject
to the scrutiny of

00:36:29.124 --> 00:36:31.369
the entire organization, to
some degree,

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:33.080
with all of your
communication.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.125
Like kind of the challenging
side of it.

00:36:35.125 --> 00:36:38.110
Then the good side is people
are much more informed about

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.930
what&#39;s happening.

00:36:40.212 --> 00:36:45.312
I guess I don&#39;t feel that I
can give much

00:36:45.312 --> 00:36:50.510
stronger endorsement of it
than it has worked so far.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.216
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a pretty good
endorsement.

00:36:52.216 --> 00:36:55.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I&#39;m actually really
curious how or whether it&#39;ll

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.940
work when we&#39;re 5,000 people
or something like that.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.950
If we&#39;re ever at that scale.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.110
&gt;&gt; I think the two things
that have

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:04.400
helped us scale it are one,
changing the tools and

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.060
two, developing the culture
around it.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.010
And so on the tools front,
you know,

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.760
used to be the case, or the
infrastructure, it

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.670
used to be the case that you
could keep abreast by what&#39;s

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.700
happening in the company by
reading all the email.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.480
Now we have weekly all-hands
sometimes on the deck,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.720
and we actually have to put
all this work into

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.830
developing a deck to, to
communicate to people what&#39;s

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.640
going on in the company,
since there&#39;s so much more.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:29.820
And the second is on the
cultural side, so much

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.660
information being available
internally, you have to

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.950
develop cultural norms
around how it&#39;s treated.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.680
Obvious things like the fact
that a lot of

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.590
it&#39;s confidential to Stripe.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:44.260
But even less obvious things
like when emailing someone

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.190
or talking in Slack or

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.860
IRESE, when that is viewed
by now 170 people,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.524
it&#39;s pretty easy to get
stage fright.

00:37:52.524 --> 00:37:55.970
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s pretty easy
for what you thought was

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.110
a reasonable proposal, you
get this drive-by criticism.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.890
And you&#39;re now less likely
to share in the future.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.200
And so, we&#39;ve had to create
norms around when it&#39;s

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.650
reasonable to jump into
discussions and

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.010
how that interaction works.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.110
Because people are on the
stage so much more.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.300
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not
good,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.530
but, not to put her on the
spot but

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.180
Emily interned at Stripe
this summer.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.140
I&#39;m curious, like,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.480
as an intern, what you
thought of it?

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.920
&gt;&gt; I think, overall, it&#39;s
great.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.351
I think, like, my first
week,

00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:24.259
I spent most of the time
reading Hackpad and

00:38:24.259 --> 00:38:26.670
getting caught up on what
the company was doing.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:28.870
It can often be quite
distracting,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.460
from your own work, as there
are oftentimes other parts

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.330
of the company you&#39;re really
interested in.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.050
&gt;&gt; Hackpad, by the way, is
like Google Docs, but

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.760
with a news feed and

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.600
that way you can just like
see all the documents.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you&#39;re
encouraged to make

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.229
everything public,
everything you work on.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.310
But overall, it gets you
spun up really quickly.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.172
And we also have things
called spin ups where

00:38:45.172 --> 00:38:47.990
every single leader of a
team at the company,

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:51.280
whether it&#39;s sys or it&#39;s
product gives like a 30

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.360
minute talk on what their
team is currently doing and

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.120
how you can contribute, if
you&#39;re interested.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.925
&gt;&gt; Do you think email
transparency was net good?

00:38:56.925 --> 00:38:59.982
&gt;&gt; Yes I remember having a
hard time understanding what

00:38:59.982 --> 00:39:02.410
I should and should not
subscribe too.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.480
And the first week having
2,000 emails in my inbox and

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.480
then by the end there are
three of four teams you

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.940
actually want that
information coming in from.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:13.903
&gt;&gt; All right, audience
questions.

00:39:13.903 --> 00:39:14.971
Yes.

00:39:14.971 --> 00:39:17.974
&gt;&gt; So this question for
Patrick and John.

00:39:17.974 --> 00:39:21.766
Is it your experience that
your early hires begin to

00:39:21.766 --> 00:39:22.383
grow and

00:39:22.383 --> 00:39:26.900
evolve into leadership roles
as the company scales?

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.421
And a question for

00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:33.330
Ben, how is the difference,
what difference is today?

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.660
How is a difference in your
initial bid run of

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.630
the product and the audience
would be?

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.080
&gt;&gt; All right, we&#39;ll go first
on.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.858
The people, actually all
three of you are welcome to

00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:44.050
answer this, have the people
that you

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:46.960
hired early been able to
grow into leadership roles?

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.470
&gt;&gt; In the Stripes case, yes,
in that quite a number of

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.410
the first ten people are in
leadership roles now.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.610
I think that&#39;s one thing
that organizations, again

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.548
it&#39;s an unnatural skill that
they have to get good at,

00:40:02.548 --> 00:40:05.800
is realizing that people
don&#39;t necessarily come out

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.140
of the womb being good at
managing or being good at

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.420
leadership and being able to
develop that in people, and

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.510
being able to help people
progress as

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.880
they spend a number of years
at the company.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.450
It&#39;s a lot of work at a time
when everyone is running

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.730
around with their hair on
fire, but it&#39;s also damaging

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.130
if the company can&#39;t develop
that skill.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:30.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think for

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.280
us the answer is some yes
and some no.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.320
I think one of the big
benefits of

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.690
working at a start-up is
that you can be

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.310
handed a challenge that no
one else would be

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.340
crazy enough to give you the
opportunity to take on.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.160
And that could managing
people.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.970
It could be taking on a
project.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.520
But the implicit contract
with that is that if

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.780
your going to ask somebody
to take a really big risk on

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.720
that, it shouldn&#39;t be like
one-way through the door and

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.380
if you don&#39;t succeed,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:57.545
otherwise it creates fright
to give it a shot.

00:40:57.545 --> 00:41:00.730
So we have some folks that
are managing large teams

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.800
that started as individual
programmers, where they were

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.680
engineering and they said
hey, I would love to try.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.220
I&#39;d love to try leading a
project and

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:07.970
then leading a group and

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.940
then taking responsibility
for

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.576
management, taking a group.

00:41:10.576 --> 00:41:11.710
And we&#39;ve had other folks
that tried it and

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.130
they were like, I&#39;m really
glad I tried it because I

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.750
never wanna do that again.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.740
We try to make sure that,
for those people, like you

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.660
can have just as much impact
at a company through your

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.510
individual contributions as
an engineer or designer.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.130
You don&#39;t have to manage.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:25.640
But it&#39;s really hard to

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.102
predict until you give
people a shot.

00:41:27.102 --> 00:41:30.800
And so my strong preference
is that you give as many

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.140
people a shot as possible,
in the few areas where you

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:38.070
really feel like there&#39;s too
much learning curve relative

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.630
to the business objective
you&#39;re trying to achieve.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.750
That&#39;s when you look for
somebody who might be able

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.470
to walk in and really
execute well in that job.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.910
Are you going to answer the
other question?

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.100
&gt;&gt; Oh, so the question was

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.170
how has the vision changed
since we initially started?

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:59.364
&gt;&gt; Yes,
&gt;&gt; Sure,

00:41:59.364 --> 00:42:04.260
well I think on the vision,
when we first started,

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.760
I think we started hiring
very inductively.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:07.300
We were like, oh, we&#39;re

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.420
gonna build this really cool
tool.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.740
People are gonna enjoy it.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.690
I love collecting things.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.670
Maybe other people like
collecting things.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:14.100
And what we didn&#39;t expect,

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.790
that kind of revealed itself
early on,

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.750
was that looking at other
people&#39;s collections turns

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.460
out to be this really
amazing way to discover

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.730
things that you didn&#39;t know
you were looking for.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:25.839
It becomes kind of a
solution to a problem that

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:27.790
a lot of other technologies
don&#39;t have.

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.980
And so, over the last couple
years especially,

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.340
we&#39;ve poured enormous kind
of technical and design

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.600
resources into building out
recommendations products,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.486
search products, feed
products.

00:42:38.486 --> 00:42:41.520
Leveraging the unique data
that we have which

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.505
are these pins that were all
hand-picked by someone and

00:42:43.505 --> 00:42:45.190
hand-categorized.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.980
And then on the audience
side, the first big

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.140
surprise was truthfully when
we first started,

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.610
we didn&#39;t really know if
anyone would use it.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.890
And we were just happy that
anybody that wasn&#39;t related

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.570
to us and

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:59.930
obligated by familial
relationship would use it.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.190
And so one of the biggest
surprises has been how many

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.662
people and how diverse those
groups of people have been.

00:43:05.662 --> 00:43:07.235
I think that&#39;s been one of

00:43:07.235 --> 00:43:09.554
the things that&#39;s really
exciting.

00:43:09.554 --> 00:43:11.290
And, the funny thing is,

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:14.460
that is often like the
company goes farther along,

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.162
your aspirations therefore
get bigger.

00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:19.440
So there&#39;s this gap that
always exists,

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.840
I tell my team, between
where we are and

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.910
where I think we should be,
and

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.100
even though objectively,
we&#39;re much farther along,

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.390
I feel like the gap has
widened even farther.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:30.290
But I think that&#39;s a really
common trait among

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.795
people who found companies.

00:43:32.795 --> 00:43:34.197
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:43:34.197 --> 00:43:35.348
&gt;&gt; You said that like,

00:43:35.348 --> 00:43:37.986
while selling a vision of
the company you had to

00:43:37.986 --> 00:43:38.731
describe and

00:43:38.731 --> 00:43:41.340
go into detail that how hard
it is going to be.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.290
And like they won&#39;t see
their families for

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:45.650
three years but then they
will also get a thing that

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.610
their grandchildren can be
proud of.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:49.050
But how do you really know?

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:51.010
Both of you know that the
second part is

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.680
not guaranteed but the first
part,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.200
if they&#39;re not gonna see
their family for

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.380
the next year, it&#39;s gonna be
a different show.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.800
So like, how can you be
authentic by selling that

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.514
vision of the company or is
it about giving high returns

00:44:02.514 --> 00:44:04.992
for the high risk they are
taking when the number of

00:44:04.992 --> 00:44:08.331
equity that already
&gt;&gt; Great question.

00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.565
So the question is,

00:44:09.565 --> 00:44:12.090
most start-ups are not the
iPhone.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:13.810
You can&#39;t guarantee that
people&#39;s grandchildren

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.820
are gonna remember this
because most start-ups fail.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.180
How do you convince people
to sort of

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.055
make sacrifices to join a
start-up?

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:25.584
&gt;&gt; I think, part of the way
in which it resonates with

00:44:25.584 --> 00:44:29.660
people is because it&#39;s not
guaranteed, right?

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.720
If it were guaranteed then
it&#39;d be boring.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:36.784
And so it&#39;s that there is
the prospect of affecting

00:44:36.784 --> 00:44:42.219
this outcome, but nothing
more than that potential.

00:44:42.219 --> 00:44:45.236
To the not seeing their
families or

00:44:45.236 --> 00:44:49.709
kids, start-ups often do
involve longer hours in

00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:52.945
the beginning, but I think,
well.

00:44:52.945 --> 00:44:55.758
I, I think that that
particular story is

00:44:55.758 --> 00:44:58.160
probably somewhat
overstated.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.650
I guess, it was, I think

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.490
Scott Forestall was trying
to recruit these people.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.830
But I mean, even though
startups,

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.790
especially in the earlier
days,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:08.830
tend to involve somewhat
longer working hours.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.950
I think it was kind of this
tendency to,

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:11.715
to exaggerate it.

00:45:11.715 --> 00:45:12.320
And sort of,

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.550
I mean it&#39;s like the startup
version of fishing.

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:17.460
Like, every startup thinks
they worked even more insane

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.570
hours than, you know,

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.530
the next one back in the
early days.

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:23.450
Like, we literally never
sleep or slept rather,

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:24.810
for two years.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.330
So I don&#39;t know.

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.980
I think that realistically
for most people,

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.350
it&#39;s not that big a
sacrifice, right?

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:35.710
You&#39;re, maybe on average,
being really realistic about

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.842
it, you&#39;ll work two hours
more on average per day.

00:45:37.842 --> 00:45:39.570
It&#39;s certainly a sacrifice,
but

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:44.770
it is not forgoing all you
know, pleasure and

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.820
enjoyment for the next half
decade.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think
even the iPhone

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.600
wasn&#39;t the iPhone before it
got done, right?

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.890
I mean, no smart person
you&#39;re hiring is

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.890
under the illusion that you
have a crystal ball into

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.170
the future that only you
have, and

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.550
that joining is a guaranteed
thing.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.590
And in fact, if you&#39;re
telling him that and

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.520
they select in, you probably
shouldn&#39;t hire them.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.452
Because they,

00:46:07.452 --> 00:46:10.394
they didn&#39;t pass like a
basic intelligence test

00:46:10.394 --> 00:46:12.992
about uncertainty in the
future.

00:46:12.992 --> 00:46:15.436
But I, but I think it&#39;s fair
to say, like you know,

00:46:15.436 --> 00:46:17.883
what&#39;s exciting and where
you think you can go, and

00:46:17.883 --> 00:46:20.920
where it&#39;s going to be hard
and chart your best plan.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.144
And then tell them why their
role in it can be

00:46:24.144 --> 00:46:26.930
instrumental, because it is.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.090
You know I really liked what
you said.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:31.340
You know, if you tell people
like hey we&#39;re gonna go

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.750
to Mars, it attracts the
best people and

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.250
then you&#39;re incrementally
closer to getting to Mars.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:37.960
And they know that going in.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.630
What I would discourage
doing is

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.720
just whitewashing all of
that.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.250
And if people kind of are
joining because they want

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.200
sort of oh, I want all this
certainty and guarantee of

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.520
working at Google, plus like
the perk of working in

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.560
a small start up and more
email, and transparency.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.440
Like that&#39;s, that&#39;s a
really,

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.365
really negative sign.

00:46:54.365 --> 00:46:57.210
And for

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.330
example, when I interview
people they&#39;ll often say oh,

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.620
I&#39;m really passionate at
what you&#39;re doing, and

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.030
then I&#39;m like well, what
else are you interviewing?

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.340
And then they&#39;ll just list
seven companies that have

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.580
nothing to do with each
other except they&#39;re sort of

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.861
at the same stage we&#39;re at.

00:47:08.861 --> 00:47:09.916
They&#39;re like, you know,

00:47:09.916 --> 00:47:11.471
I love the problem of
discovery, so

00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:15.060
I&#39;m interviewing at Stripe,
Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.200
Now I&#39;m also putting into my
resumé into Google X,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.730
into that part of the
division.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:19.960
And that&#39;s a sign that
they&#39;re probably not

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.420
being authentic with which
they care about.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.660
&gt;&gt; And those folks often,
when things get really hard,

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.855
they won&#39;t stick it out and
work through it.

00:47:26.855 --> 00:47:28.480
Because they were really
signing up for

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.520
an experience, not for
achieving a goal.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.650
&gt;&gt; I think the other thing
that motivates people

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:37.650
a great deal, in addition to
the prospect of sort of

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:40.797
them you know, affecting
some outcome is just sort of

00:47:40.797 --> 00:47:42.680
the personal development
angle.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.340
And that a start up,

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:47.170
just because it&#39;s much, kind
of more lightly staffed.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.280
It&#39;s much less forgiving,
right?

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.038
In that, like,

00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:53.099
even if you&#39;re the best
person in the world,

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:54.249
if you&#39;re not going to.

00:47:54.249 --> 00:47:55.687
Well, whether or not you&#39;re
the best or

00:47:55.687 --> 00:47:57.550
the worst person in the
world, you&#39;re probably not

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.835
going to significantly alter
Google&#39;s trajectory, right?

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:02.860
Whereas if you sort of,

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.810
really wanted to benchmark
yourself, and

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.880
see how much a contribution
and an impact you can make.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.990
And I think that prospect is
quite compelling to a lot of

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.350
the best people, then a
start up is

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:18.120
a much better place to, to
go test that.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:18.660
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.850
&gt;&gt; Last question, who&#39;d you
want?

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.280
Last question.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.670
So this question is for

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.880
Ben, but you guys can all
answer it.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.590
But how has your user base
effected your

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.540
hiring strategies?

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:32.759
So Pinterest is a site
that&#39;s used like 80% by

00:48:32.759 --> 00:48:33.569
women, so

00:48:33.569 --> 00:48:36.700
how did that effect your
initial hiring decisions?

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.020
&gt;&gt; How has your user base
effected your

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.560
hiring strategy?

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:41.690
&gt;&gt; Yes, so, You know,

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.040
conventional wisdom is like
you only hire people that

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.820
religiously use your product
every single day.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.010
And that probably works
really well if

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.272
you&#39;re making an API,
probably amazing.

00:48:50.272 --> 00:48:54.930
For us, we screen for people
that are ambitious and

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:58.780
excited about the vision of
cracking discovery online.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.900
And they have to know
exactly how

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.720
our service works and have
to have used it.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.490
But they may not be a
lifelong user.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.770
And that, for us it&#39;s this
great opportunity because we

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.700
can be like, what is the
barrier that&#39;s

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.270
preventing you from using
it?

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:12.100
Come join, remove that
barrier,

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.303
and help us get closer to
that vision.

00:49:15.303 --> 00:49:17.860
I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a lot
of,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.420
if you read any sort of
book, there&#39;s all this

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.050
startup wisdom that sounds
like really reasonable.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.200
But it&#39;s only useful if it
works in

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.060
your particular
circumstance.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.340
And so for us, we&#39;ve had to
sort of

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:31.360
broaden the lens a little
bit in looking broadly about

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.169
people that are ambitious
about the mission.

00:49:33.169 --> 00:49:34.620
That care about the product
and

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.290
our approach to building
products,

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.509
even if from day one, they
weren&#39;t our earliest users.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:44.140
&gt;&gt; The one thing I&#39;ll just
tack on to that is that when

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.830
we talked about the fact
that, you know,

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:48.500
it&#39;s really hard to hire for
those early employees.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.760
And you know, you have
people who have

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:50.880
other good options.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.890
You&#39;re very much at the ugly
duckling stage.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:56.714
Finding people who are
passionate about your

00:49:56.714 --> 00:49:58.399
product can be a great way
to find people.

00:49:58.399 --> 00:50:01.888
Because there you kind of
have an unnatural advantage

00:50:01.888 --> 00:50:03.443
over other companies.

00:50:03.443 --> 00:50:04.784
And so I know, for

00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:09.258
sure, in Stripe&#39;s case, we
definitely, we hired I think

00:50:09.258 --> 00:50:13.690
it was four Stripe users in
the very early days.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.150
And you know, those were
people who,

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.540
who we probably couldn&#39;t
have gotten otherwise.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.196
I&#39;m sure it was the same in
Pinterest&#39;s case,

00:50:21.196 --> 00:50:23.830
where you&#39;ll get all this
benefit of working at

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:25.630
Pinterest and hey, it&#39;s
Pinterest.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.170
And you get to work where
you pin.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.469
Yeah.

00:50:29.469 --> 00:50:30.618
&gt;&gt; Thank you guys very much
for coming in today.

00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:33.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

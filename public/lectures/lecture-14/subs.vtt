00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.620
So I&#39;m going to talk about how
to operate.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.740
So I&#39;ve watched some of the
prior classes, and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.470
I&#39;m going to assume that
you&#39;ve already sort of

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.590
hired a bunch of horrendously
resourceful people.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.570
That you&#39;ve built a product
that at

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.300
least some people love.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.260
And you&#39;re probably raised
some capital.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.660
And now you&#39;re trying to build
a company.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.420
So you&#39;re, you&#39;re enforging a
product and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.800
now you have to forge a
company.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.650
And it actually argue for

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.100
GM company is much more
difficult than for

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.170
a GM product.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.720
Basic reason is people are
irrational.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.260
So you probably all know this
either your parents,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.170
your significant other or your
brother or sister, or

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.490
your teacher, somebody in your
life is irrational.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.890
Building a company is
basically taking all

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.740
the irrational people you
know, putting them in one

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.830
building and then living with
them 12 hours a day at least.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.930
So, it&#39;s very challenging.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.520
Now, there&#39;s techniques for
coping with that and

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.640
some people get good at it and
small people don&#39;t but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.289
that&#39;s where really what
operating is about.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.963
So basically what you&#39;re doing
when you build a company is

00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:45.179
you&#39;re building an engine.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.166
And at first you have a
drawing literally on a white

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.868
board, and you&#39;re architecting
it, and it

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:54.655
looks very conceptually clean,
and beautiful, and pretty.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:56.264
But when you start actually
translating to

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.052
practice actually it looks
more like this, and

00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:59.760
you&#39;re holding it together
with duct tape.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.812
And it takes a lot of heroic
effort to people to

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.110
actually hold it together.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.100
That&#39;s why people work 80, 100
hours a week,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.820
is that heroic effort is
actually necessary to keep

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.610
this thing together.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.330
Because you don&#39;t actually yet
have polished metal in place.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.850
Eventually you

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.880
want to construct a high
performance machine.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.370
A machine that actually almost
nobody really has to

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.850
worry about every hour.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.330
Every minute and you know as
we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.430
used to joke about Ebay that
if Martians took over Ebay it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.470
would take like six months for
the world to notice.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.290
That&#39;s what eventually what
you want to get to.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.510
Or as Warren Buffet says, you
know, build a company that

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.490
idiots could run because
eventually they will.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.010
So this is what you want
basically a performance

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.069
machine that idiots can run.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.190
Now, as a leader, what is your
real job?

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.268
What&#39;s your role?

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:43.360
Strictly speaking there&#39;s only
one book that&#39;s ever written

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.339
that actually explains how to
do this, it&#39;s a little old.

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:47.196
It was written in 1992 by Andy
Grove,

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:49.266
who&#39;s quite famous, quite
successful, and

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.857
his definition of what your
job is,

00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:52.928
is to maximize the output of
an organization,

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:55.530
your organization that you&#39;re
responsible for, CEOs,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.630
everything and a VP would be
part of the organization.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810
And the organizations around
you, so if you&#39;re VPE,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
you&#39;re actually are
responsible for

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.320
the performance of the product
team too, or

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.760
the marketing team, because
you have influence there.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.110
So this is how measure people
and you want to focus on

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.390
the output not the input the
old adage about measuring,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.780
not measuring motion and
confusing that will progress,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.950
you&#39;re measuring only
progress.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.310
And this is going to sound
like a fancy and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.300
glamorous thing to do.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.330
Maybe people get excited about
managing a whole

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.390
large organization, and being
responsible for the output.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.450
But in practice, what you&#39;re
going to learn today hopefully

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.240
is that it&#39;s more about things
like ordering smoothies,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.850
teaching your receptionist how
to answer the phone properly,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.060
and serving as a $10 an hour
task rabbit for

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.050
your employees.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.230
So let&#39;s talk about that.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.080
So at first when you

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.630
start a company everything&#39;s
going to feel like a mess.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.950
And it really should if you
have too much process,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.760
too much predictability you&#39;re
probably not

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.550
innovating fast enough and
creatively enough.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.550
So it should feel like
everyday there&#39;s a new

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.300
problem and what you&#39;re doing
is fundamentally triaging.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.360
So some things will look like
a problem, and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.750
they&#39;re actually a colds,
they&#39;re just going to go away.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.620
So, somebody&#39;s annoyed about
this or that.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.570
That may be a cold, and you
shouldn&#39;t stress about it,

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.900
and you certainly shouldn&#39;t
allocated a lot of

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.420
your time to it.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.400
And some things are going to
present themselves as colds.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.515
But just like in the emergency
room, if they&#39;re not

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:12.693
diagnosed properly they
actually can become fatal.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.489
So what I&#39;m going to try to do
is help give you

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.823
frameworks for thinking about
which things are colds and

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:18.390
which things are potentially
fatal.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.680
So one of the most important
things I&#39;ve learned at

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.240
Square is actually a concept
of editing.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.960
And this is the,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.600
I think the best metaphor I&#39;ve
ever seen in like 14 years of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.470
running stuff of how to think
about your job.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.290
It&#39;s natural, it&#39;s a natural
metaphor so

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.680
it&#39;s easy to take with you
every day.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.000
And actually it&#39;s easy to
transmit to each of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.910
your employees so that they
can figure out

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.510
wether they are editing or
writing.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.720
It&#39;s a natural construct.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.360
You generally know when
someone asks you to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.220
do something.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.850
Am I more writing or am I more
editing?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.490
So an editor, as, is the best
metaphor for your job,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.150
and we&#39;re talking about the
specific things you&#39;re doing

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.620
in editing.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.010
The first thing an editor
does, and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.950
you probably all had this
experience in school,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.630
is you submit a paper to a TA,
a draft to your friend.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.860
And the first thing an editor
does is

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.970
they take out a red pen or
nowadays, you know online, and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.570
they start striking things.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.750
Basically eliminating things.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.090
The most important task as an
editor is to simplify,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.630
simplify, and that usually
means omitting things.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.590
So that&#39;s your job too, is to
clarify and simplify for

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.810
everybody on your team,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.940
the more you simplify the
better people will perform.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.610
People cannot understand and

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.910
keep track of a complicated
set of initiatives.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.230
So you&#39;ve got to distill it
down to one, two, or

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.270
three things.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.610
And use a framework that they
can repeat,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.310
they can repeat without
thinking about,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.630
they can repeat to their
friends,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.480
they can repeat at night.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.580
Don&#39;t except the excuse of
complexity.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.240
A lot of people will tell you
that well this is

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.590
too challenging, this is too
complicated.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.380
Well yeah, I know other people
simplify but

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.150
that&#39;s not for me.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.950
This is a complicated
business.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.930
They&#39;re wrong.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.085
You can change the world, in
140 characters.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.911
You can build the most
important companies in

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:53.910
history in a very simple to
describe concept.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.970
You can market products in
less than about 50 characters.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.100
There&#39;s no reason why you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.820
can&#39;t build your company the
same way.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.520
So force yourself to simplify
every initiative,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.630
every product, every
marketing, every,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.960
everything you do.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.790
And, and basically take out
that red,

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.430
and start eliminating stuff.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.700
Second thing is, what editors
do,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.560
is they ask you clarifying
questions.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.950
So when you present a paper to
somebody,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.720
what do they usually do?

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.000
Do they, find some ambiguity
somewhere and

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.650
they say, well did you really
mean this, do you mean that,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.990
do you have an example of
this?

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.190
That&#39;s what your job is, so
you&#39;re in a meeting and

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.360
people are going to look to
you, and the real thing you

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.780
do is you actually ask a lot
of questions.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.630
And they can be simple, basic
questions like,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.660
should we try this seven days
a week or six days?

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.200
They can be fundamental
questions like,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.330
where&#39;s our competitive
advantage here?

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.160
We try to this actually as
investors too

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.750
some investors will ask you a
billion questions about

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.560
a billion things and they&#39;ll
have you do diligence forever.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.110
We try to narrow it down to
what are one, two or

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.650
three four things that
actually matter for

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.070
this company and only focus on
those things.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.660
So it allows us to be more
decisive, and

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.100
we can make decisions rapidly.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.090
It allows us not to distract
you from your day job,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.920
which is actually building a
company.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.035
And yet, I think we still get
to the higher fide,

00:06:07.035 --> 00:06:08.280
highest fidelity answers.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.320
We don&#39;t have all these extra,

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.340
extraneous details, pieces of
data.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.850
Now it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s something
you have to practice, but

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.810
when you&#39;re good at it, every
step you eliminate, Andy Grove

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.560
estimated that you can improve
performance by 30-50%.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.830
The next thing you do is
allocate resources.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.110
So the editing construct,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.890
this is what editors do all
the time.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.160
They take editors from the
mid-East and

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.480
covering the mid-East and they
move them to Silicon Valley,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.840
because Silicon Valley is now,
now more interesting.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.510
Or they move them to a sports
section because they want to

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.680
compete on the basis of sports
with other journals and

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.370
other publications.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.650
So that can be top down where
I take a bunch of,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.710
allocate resources and

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.360
people would say, we&#39;re now
going over here,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.910
we&#39;re going to compete on this
basis.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.060
And then next month, next
quarter, next year,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.650
I&#39;m like well,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.780
that Middle East coverage is
getting boring and bland.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.930
We don&#39;t want to do that
anymore.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.250
Let&#39;s go chase after something
else, or it can be bottom up,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.920
just like journalists mostly
come up

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.840
with their own stories, the
people who work with you.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.260
Generally should be coming up
with their own initiatives.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.231
So, a reporter will generally,
who covers Google, come up

00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:04.913
with the interesting stories
that they&#39;re hearing in

00:07:04.913 --> 00:07:07.961
aether, and propose one or two
to their editor for approval.

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:09.994
But it&#39;s not like the editor
is saying, go cover Google,

00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:10.998
and this is the angle I want.

00:07:10.998 --> 00:07:12.227
Once in a while they do that,
but

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:13.915
that&#39;s not the date, the day,
the meat and

00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:16.520
potatoes of what a journalist
does every day.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.500
Your goal over time is to
actually use less red

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.650
ink every day.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.474
So one way of measuring how
well you&#39;re doing in

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:23.158
communicating to

00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:25.446
your colleagues about what&#39;s
important and what&#39;s not.

00:07:25.446 --> 00:07:27.119
What, why some things are
important,

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:28.031
some things are not,

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.470
is how much red ink you&#39;re
pulling out every day.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.930
It&#39;s okay if you have a bad
day and

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.490
the red inks all over the
place.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.970
But it&#39;s not okay if the red
ink next month is

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.350
more is more than it was last
month,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.820
if the next quarter is more
than this.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.380
So measure yourself of how
much red ink you&#39;re creating.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.450
The other thing that&#39;s very
important that actually isn&#39;t

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.380
as intuitive to a lot of
people is,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.140
the job of an editor is to
ensure consistent voice.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.880
So if any of you read The
Economist,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.460
you can tell that there&#39;s one
consistent voice.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.250
You can pick up any article,
any post in The Economist, and

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.360
if feels like it&#39;s written by
the same person.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.980
Ideally your company should
feel like,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.480
on your website and your PR
release,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.700
on your packaging, if it&#39;s a
physical product.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.810
Anywhere on your recruiting
pages to feel like it

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.110
was written by one person.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.570
That&#39;s extremely difficult to
do,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.300
and first you&#39;re going to be
tempted to do

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.390
that yourself which is okay
for a founder to that.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.060
Him or herself initially.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.230
Over time you do not want to
be doing all of

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.920
the consistent voice editing
by yourself.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.190
You are a trained people so

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.950
that they can recognize the
differences in voice.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.430
So if you see this website
page it

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.190
looks very different than the
recruiting page.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.410
You start by asking questions
why is that?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.550
Is the reporting messed up?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.910
Is the leaders over here not

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.960
really understanding the voice
of the company?

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.110
So, you&#39;ve gotta, you have to
fix that over time.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.920
But you want to start with the
objective of

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.280
everything should feel exactly
the same.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.250
It&#39;s quite, quite difficult in
practice.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.800
Almost every company has at
least one piece

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.470
of the organization that isn&#39;t
exactly on the same voice.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.980
At Apple, which is notorious,
you know,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.130
even under Steve&#39;s regime,
which was notorious for

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.610
getting this right.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.710
If you asked someone who
worked at Apple, talk,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.030
asked them about the internal
tools about recruiting.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.580
Do they really feel like Apple
products?

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.910
All of them will tell you no.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.320
So you&#39;re never 100%,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.590
but you definitely want to get
a close to that as you can.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.520
Next complicated topic is
delegating.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.680
So just like the other thing I

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.000
like about the metaphor of
editing is.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.090
Writers do most of the work in
the world.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.000
Editors are not actually
writing most of the content in

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.380
any publication.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.190
So that&#39;s actually true of
your company.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.720
You are not going to do most
of the work.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.440
You shouldn&#39;t be doing most of
the work.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.210
And the way you get out of
doing most of

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.950
the work is you actually
delegate.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.390
Now the problem with
delegating is,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.300
that actually you&#39;re
responsible for everything.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.800
So as CEO founder there is no
excuse,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.510
there&#39;s no like that&#39;s that
department over there,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.110
this person over there screwed
up,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.390
you&#39;re always responsible for

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.530
every single thing, especially
when things go wrong.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.790
So how do you both delegate
but not abdicate.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.320
It&#39;s pretty tricky challenge
and

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.640
both are sins, like if you
over delegate.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.146
Or, and you advocate, or

00:09:47.146 --> 00:09:49.850
you micro-manage, those are
both sins.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.400
So I&#39;m going to give you a
couple techniques for

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.120
solving this.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.858
First, this actually comes
from high output management

00:09:56.858 --> 00:09:59.740
and to grow, is what&#39;s known
as task-relevant maturity.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.060
It&#39;s kind of a fancy phrase
for

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.820
basically, has this person
ever done this before?

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.010
It&#39;s really simple.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.410
And how mature is this person
in doing something/ And

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.750
the more they&#39;ve done the
exact same task before.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.560
The more sort of rope you&#39;re
going to give them.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.320
And the less, the more they&#39;re
trying something new,

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.320
the more you&#39;re going to
actually instruct them and

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.670
consistently, constantly
regularly monitor.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.406
So that&#39;s kind of a basic
concept but

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:21.593
it&#39;s worth keeping in the back
of your brain.

00:10:21.593 --> 00:10:23.766
The interesting implication,
and

00:10:23.766 --> 00:10:26.737
this is pretty radical, is
that any executive,

00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:29.569
any CEO should not have one
management style.

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:31.924
Your management style actually
needs to be dictated by

00:10:31.924 --> 00:10:32.646
your employee.

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:35.685
So with one particular person,
you may be very much a micro

00:10:35.685 --> 00:10:38.364
manager because they&#39;re quite
low on this scale.

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:40.370
And with another person you
may be delegating a lot

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.020
because they&#39;re actually quite
mature on this scale.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.274
So it&#39;s actually a good thing
if you do reference checks on

00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:47.574
somebody, and half the people
you call say they&#39;re a micro

00:10:47.574 --> 00:10:49.644
manager, and the other half
say they actually give me

00:10:49.644 --> 00:10:51.622
a lot of responsibility,
that&#39;s actually not a,

00:10:51.622 --> 00:10:53.186
that&#39;s a, that&#39;s a feature not
a bug.

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:55.916
I didn&#39;t understand that at
first, at all, like I used to

00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:58.817
be befuddled when people would
dereference checks on me, and

00:10:58.817 --> 00:11:01.354
come back with this like,
complicated mosaic.

00:11:01.354 --> 00:11:03.568
And that basically, finally
figured out that maybe I

00:11:03.568 --> 00:11:05.386
was actually doing my job
correctly, and so

00:11:05.386 --> 00:11:06.074
then of course,

00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:08.824
thought other people that this
was the way to do it.

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:12.304
A more nuanced answer though,
that I&#39;ve sort of came up

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.777
with, is how, how do you make
decisions?

00:11:14.777 --> 00:11:17.276
And delegating versus doing it
yourself.

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:19.337
You don&#39;t want to do it
yourself too often.

00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:21.813
So what I&#39;ve basically
borrowed from Peter,

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:25.113
this is my first two by two
matrix ever in my life but he

00:11:25.113 --> 00:11:28.351
taught me something at least
is you basically sort you,

00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.269
your own level conviction
about a decision on a grid you

00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:33.850
know, extremely high,
extremely low.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.880
There&#39;s times when you know
something&#39;s a mistake, and

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.450
there&#39;s times where you
wouldn&#39;t do it that way, but

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.783
you have no real idea what
the, whether,

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.520
whether it&#39;s the right or
wrong answer.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.440
And then there&#39;s a consequence
to mention, there are things

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.060
that if you make the wrong
decision are actually

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.480
catastrophic to your company
and you will fail.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.280
There are things that are
pretty low impact,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.420
that really at the end of the
day aren&#39;t going to

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.190
make a big difference, at
least initially.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.275
So what I basically believe is
that where there&#39;s low

00:11:57.275 --> 00:11:59.090
consequences, and

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.130
you have very a low confidence
in your own opinion, you

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.880
should absolutely delegate,
and delegate completely like

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.930
people make mistakes and
learn.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:08.200
On the other side obviously,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.980
where the consequences are
extremely dramatic and

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.590
you have extremely high
conviction that you&#39;re right,

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.060
you actually can&#39;t let your
junior colleague,

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.200
like, make a mistake.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.100
You&#39;re ultimately responsible
for that mistake, and if

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.140
it&#39;s really important you just
can&#39;t allow that to happen.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.080
Now the best way to do

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.140
that is to actually explain
your thinking, the why.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.680
It&#39;s easy to shortcut when you
get busy,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.500
explaining why&#39;s of the world,
but it&#39;s very important to try

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.710
when I was at LinkedIn I had a
colleague who&#39;s quite,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.678
quite talented.

00:12:36.678 --> 00:12:40.240
Both occasion we get annoyed
if, if I didn&#39;t exactly agree

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.870
with his opinion on something,
and so I&#39;d

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.700
spent a lot of time trying to
persuade him why I was making

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.150
a decision a certain way.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.580
And his wildcard, the card he
would ultimately call out if I

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.680
didn&#39;t quite persuade him,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.510
he&#39;s like, okay you&#39;re the
boss, and that meant to

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.680
me like I was burning a lot of
social capital.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.260
Every time he said that, I
knew I was like

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.150
really creating a thin line,
and that ultimately that was

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.970
going to backfire if I did
that too often, so

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.440
you want to track the times
that you&#39;re doing that.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.580
Example of this is Squares,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.870
one of my favorite people in
the world,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.850
and my second hire, first
marketing hire had this

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.890
program he wanted to run
called Inner-Square,

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.740
which basically allowed people
to give out square merchants

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.860
to get out ten other squares
to their call.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.210
Just imagine a food truck
outside,

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.590
put like ten squares on the
counter and

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.500
people could just grab them,
and Kyle had this great idea,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.560
this would be this awesome
marketing program.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.510
Squares would spread squares
to other people and, you know,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.660
to some extent it was on
brand, so

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.940
it didn&#39;t have catastrophic
consequences.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.300
Each of these ten squares
didn&#39;t cost that much money,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.300
so financially we could afford
to do it.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.120
But, at that time my ten years
of experience said

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.490
there&#39;s just no way this is
going to work in

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.930
a meaningful enough scale, to
move our metrics enough and

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.957
I actually would prefer we
don&#39;t, not do this.

00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:50.470
But Kyle, so

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.490
excited about this that I
decided to just let him do it.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.680
He learned that actually when
you

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.550
measure this thing it&#39;s not
massive.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.900
It doesn&#39;t create a massive
value for the company.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.950
It did require a fair amount
of operational complexity to

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.170
ship all these squares to
people and

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.730
figure out how to get them to
be squares etc.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.620
But it allowed him to be
excited about his job and

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.720
to learn how to filter future
ideas, so it&#39;s totally worth

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.320
letting him make the quote
unquote mistake.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.280
The next and most possibly
most important thing you do

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.070
is actually edit the team.

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.845
So these are the people that
you work with, and

00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:23.750
nobody&#39;s going to have a
perfect team and

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.510
you&#39;re certainly not going to
start that way.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.250
So would, I&#39;m going to try to
do is

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.490
maximize the probability for
success in editing the team.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.890
So I like this idea of Barrels
and Ammunition.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.878
Most companies once they get
into hiring mode as

00:14:36.878 --> 00:14:39.113
Sam pointed out you should
defer that for awhile, but

00:14:39.113 --> 00:14:40.862
once you do they just hire a
lot of people.

00:14:40.862 --> 00:14:42.505
And they&#39;re like, you expect,
and

00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:44.679
you expected as you add people
your throughput,

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.634
your horsepower, or

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:48.243
your velocity of shipping
things is going to increase.

00:14:48.243 --> 00:14:50.099
It turns out it doesn&#39;t work
that way.

00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:51.741
Usually when you hire more
engineers you

00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.430
actually don&#39;t get that much
more done,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.420
you actually sometimes get
less done.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.280
You hire more designers,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.450
you definitely don&#39;t get more
done,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.200
you get less done per day we
could talk about why.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.290
But so the reason why is that
most people,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.540
most great people even, are
actually ammunition.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.320
But what you need in your
company are barrels, and

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.960
you can only shoot through the
number of

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.420
unique barrels you have.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.670
So that&#39;s how the velocity of
your company improves is by

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.570
adding barrels, and then you
stock them with ammunition,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.710
and then you can do a lot.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.310
So if you go from a one barrel
company,

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.990
which is mostly how you start.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.000
To two barrel companies
suddenly you get twice as many

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.390
things done per day, per week,
per quarter, and if you go to

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.970
three barrels, great, if you
go to four barrels, awesome.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.920
Barrels are incredibly
difficult to find,

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.010
but when you have them, like
give them lots of equity,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.480
promote them, take them to
dinner every week because it,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.300
it, they&#39;re virtually it like
irreplaceable.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.800
Because they&#39;re also very
culturally specific.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.980
So a barrel at one company may
not be a barrel at

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.570
another company because one of
the ways in the definition of

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.210
a barrel is they can take an
idea from inception

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.410
all the way through shipping
and bring people with them.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.230
And that&#39;s a very culturally
specific opportunity specific

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.260
skill set, rather.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.490
So two questions probably are
occurring to you,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.620
is how do you figure out who&#39;s
a barrel and who&#39;s not?

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.330
One is you start actually with
a very small set of

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.100
responsibilities.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.670
It can be fairly trivial.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.260
It can be something like, I
want to reward

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.360
the engineers that are in my
office at 9 o&#39;clock at

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.750
night every night with an ice
cold fresh smoothie.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.460
This is actually a real
example.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.131
I was frustrated our engineers
were

00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:21.465
working really hard at square.

00:16:21.465 --> 00:16:22.182
And, you know,

00:16:22.182 --> 00:16:24.847
maybe 20% to 30% would stay
very late into evening, and

00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:27.254
I wanted to serve, we were
ready to serve them dinner but

00:16:27.254 --> 00:16:29.509
I wanted to give them
something cool to reward them,

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:31.200
and you could think about
alcohol, but

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.870
that&#39;s a little complicated.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.820
So smoothies were probably a
little bit

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.510
better than the pizza, which
drains you of energy.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.260
But nobody could get smoothies
in my office to show up at 9

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.770
o&#39;clock sharp that were cold,
that tasted good and delivered

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.730
in the right place that
engineers would find them.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.940
You&#39;d think this is simple,
but

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.430
in fact, it like, took months
to get this right.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.328
So then we had an in, we had
an intern start, and

00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:52.371
I think on his second day,

00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:53.699
I was explaining this problem
and

00:16:53.699 --> 00:16:56.166
he, he said, well, I&#39;ll do it,
and I was like looking at and

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:57.272
I&#39;m like there&#39;s no way.

00:16:57.272 --> 00:16:59.658
I&#39;ve seen my office manager
fail, my assistant fail,

00:16:59.658 --> 00:17:01.394
all who are actually pretty
good.

00:17:01.394 --> 00:17:03.936
This just isn&#39;t going to
happen, and then long and

00:17:03.936 --> 00:17:07.036
behold that night they show up
on time, cold, delivered to

00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:09.888
the right place, and my first
instinct was great not,

00:17:09.888 --> 00:17:11.820
not, nothing about the
smoothies.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.183
But okay, now I can actually
give you something more

00:17:14.183 --> 00:17:16.868
important and inconsequential
and complicated to do, and

00:17:16.868 --> 00:17:18.962
that&#39;s what you actually want
to do with every

00:17:18.962 --> 00:17:21.430
single employee every single
day is expand the scope of

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.139
their responsibilities until
it breaks and it will break.

00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:27.112
Everybody like, I couldn&#39;t run
the world, like everybody has

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:29.698
like some level of complexity
that they can handle, and

00:17:29.698 --> 00:17:32.009
what you want to do is keep
expanding it until you see

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.869
where it breaks and that&#39;s the
role that they should stay in,

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:36.650
that level of sophistication.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.830
But some people will surprise
you,

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.370
there will be people who you
don&#39;t expect without,

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.740
with different backgrounds,
without a lot of experience

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.100
that just can handle
enormously complicated tasks,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.930
and so keep testing that and
pushing the envelope.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.050
The other signal to look for

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.000
is once you&#39;ve hired someone
is this,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.590
with an open office just watch
who goes up to other people&#39;s

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.860
desks, particularly people
that they don&#39;t report to.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.515
If people start going to your
desk,

00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:00.540
someone individual employee&#39;s
desk and

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.490
they don&#39;t report to them.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.660
It&#39;s a sign that they believe
that,

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.100
that person can help them.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.490
So if you see that
consistently,

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.550
those are your barrels.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.260
Just promote them,

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.150
give them more opportunity as
fast as you can.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.310
The other question everybody
asks about people is,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.470
when do you hire somebody
above somebody?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.180
And when do you sort of mentor
somebody or

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.846
when do you need to replace
somebody?

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:21.510
And the way, the way to think
about this is

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.100
every company has its own
growth rate and

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.960
every individual has its own
growth rate.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.780
So some companies that are
very successful,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.880
let&#39;s say LinkedIn.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.370
LinkedIn was always a very
linear company,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.810
it never went like this.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.640
So for example I joined
LinkedIn 18 months after we

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.150
launched and we had only 1.5
million users which in

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.960
a social product is very small
in number and

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.910
when I joined I was the 27th
employee.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:42.690
When I left two and

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.060
a half years later we only had
57 employees.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.380
In contrast when I joined
Square as a 20th employee,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.507
two and a half years later, we
had like 250,300 employees.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.176
So each company has it&#39;s own
velocity on this curve, and

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.844
if the company&#39;s going like
this,

00:18:57.844 --> 00:19:00.179
you can only keep people in
the roles that their own

00:19:00.179 --> 00:19:02.500
personal learning curve is
going like this.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.740
On the other hand, if the
company&#39;s growing like this,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.740
anybody whose learning curve
is faster than that,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.080
you can keep giving them the
same role to do.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.300
So always track like the
individual slope of,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.660
of an employee, and the
company&#39;s growth rate.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.740
Now you have your barrels
identified, so

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.500
you&#39;re pick out the people
that can really take an idea

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.940
that you have in the back of
your head scope it out,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.410
run with it, make it happen,
ship it,

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.790
and it&#39;s perfect, where do you
aim these barrels?

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.400
So I&#39;m going to argue that you
really need to spend a lot of

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.260
time focusing people.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.660
This is something I&#39;ve learned
from Peter Thiel, actually.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.590
He used to insist the PayPal,
that every single person could

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.810
only do exactly one thing and
we all rebelled.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.890
Every single person in the
company rebelled to this idea.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.310
Because it&#39;s so unnatural,
it&#39;s so different than every

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.070
other company where people
want to do multiple things,

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.317
and especially as you get more
senior you want to definitely

00:19:49.317 --> 00:19:51.220
want to do multiple things,
and you&#39;re, you&#39;re like,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.810
you feel like insulting to be
asked to do just one thing,

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.460
and Peter would enforce this
pretty strictly.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.300
He&#39;d basically say I will not
talk to you about anything

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.320
else except this one thing
I&#39;ve assigned to you.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.380
I don&#39;t want to hear about how
great you&#39;re doing over here.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.620
Like just shut up, and peer
would run away and

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.410
then focus until you conquer
this one problem, and

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.950
the insight behind this is
that most people will

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.970
solve problems that they
understand how to solve.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.689
Roughly speaking, they will
solve B

00:20:17.689 --> 00:20:19.711
plus problems instead of A
plus problems.

00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.470
A plus problems are high
impact problems for

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.960
your company, but they&#39;re
difficult.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.910
You don&#39;t wake up in the
morning with a solution, so

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.290
you tend to procrastinate
them.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.690
So imagine you wake up in the
morning,

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.790
you create a list of things to
do today.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.890
There&#39;s usually the A plus 1
at the top of the list but

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.390
you never get around to it,
and so

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.550
you solve the second and
third, and over

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.030
an entire company of hundreds
of people that just cascades.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.050
So you have a company that&#39;s
always solving B plus things.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.192
Which does mean you grow and
does mean you add value.

00:20:42.192 --> 00:20:44.710
But you never really create
that breakthrough idea because

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.226
no one is spending 100% of
their time banging their head

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:49.254
against the wall every day
until they solve it.

00:20:49.254 --> 00:20:51.487
So I highly recommend some
version of that.

00:20:51.487 --> 00:20:52.973
You can be less stringent.

00:20:52.973 --> 00:20:54.447
You can be like you can get.

00:20:54.447 --> 00:20:57.465
Three things to work on, but
there, I would still track at

00:20:57.465 --> 00:21:00.240
least the concept of what
would happen if you only gave

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.170
everybody one thing to
prioritize.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.260
Now, because you can&#39;t make
decisions, you don&#39;t want be

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.440
making all these decisions
yourself, you have to

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.060
create tools that enable
people to make decisions.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.780
At the same level ideally of
fidelity that you would make

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.770
them yourself.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.390
So how do you create scale and
leverage?

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.570
First, thing I&#39;d recommend is
building a dashboard.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.910
This is an old square
dashboard.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.210
It actually looks pretty
presentable even today.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.090
The construct of a dashboard,
first of all,

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.340
should be drafted by a
founder.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.190
You need to basically simplify
the value proposition in

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.620
the company&#39;s metrics for
success on a whiteboard.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.140
You can have other people
build the dashboard,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.770
I don&#39;t actually care about
that, but

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.760
you need to draw it out.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.450
Like what does business
success look, look to us and

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.670
what are the key inputs to
those, and then

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.580
have someone create something
that is very intuitive for

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:51.410
every single person in

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.940
the company including customer
support to use.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.920
And then,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.560
the key metric of whether
you&#39;ve succeeded is what

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.200
fraction of your employees use
that dashboard every day.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.240
If it&#39;s actually useful it
should be close to 100%.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.910
It&#39;s not going to be probably
100%,

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.120
but you want to measure that.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.740
Just like you have quality
scores for

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.460
all your other KPIs with
users,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.200
the dashboard needs to be as
intuitive as it is

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.780
as your product is for users.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.630
Other things, wait, hold on.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.210
Yeah, let&#39;s go back, one
second.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.810
Another concept is
transparency.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.720
And people will often.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.220
That&#39;s weird.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.690
Okay.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.340
Transparency, people talk a
lot about.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.440
It&#39;s kind of a goal that
everybody ascribes to, but

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.110
when push comes to

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.340
shove very few people actually
adhere to it.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.660
So let me walk through a
little bit of transparency and

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.050
different stages of
transparency.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.080
Metrics are the first step.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.000
So everybody in your company
absolutely should have

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.600
access to every single thing
that&#39;s going on.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.790
Other things that I like to do
are take your board decks, and

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.390
as you get more formal, the
board decks will get

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.890
more complicated, and actually
review every single slide with

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.080
every single employee after
the board meeting.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.120
You can strip out the
compensation information if

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.270
you really want to.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.860
But every other slide you
should go

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.390
through with the entire
employee base and explain it.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.960
And if you can remember some
of the feedback you

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.440
got from your board that&#39;s
really cool to pass on.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.810
Another thing we did at
Square,

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.990
as your company skills,

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.675
everybody&#39;s not going to get
invited to every meeting, but

00:23:13.675 --> 00:23:15.590
they want to go to every
meeting.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.540
The way you scale that is you
create notes for

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.810
every meeting and you send it
to the entire company.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.250
So we created a notes at alias
for

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.510
every single meeting involving
more than two people,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.140
someone would write notes and
send it to the entire company.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.640
So people felt like as the
company added employees,

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.990
they could continue to monitor
and

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.580
track what was interesting,
what was going on,

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.160
and they never felt excluded,
hopefully.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.730
The other thing is

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.900
like even the details around
conference rooms.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.580
Every conference room at
Square has glass walls,

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.210
because as soon as you have
regular walls,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.870
people wonder what&#39;s going on.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.910
It&#39;s amazing, like if they can
see who&#39;s actually in

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.530
the meeting, and who&#39;s meeting
with who and when.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.920
They don&#39;t worry nearly as
much as

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.170
what&#39;s going on behind those
closed doors.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.860
Stripe, you may have seen a
blog post, but I

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.630
think Patrick wrote it, about
email transparency, about

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.010
actually allowing everybody to
have access to email.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:00.490
That&#39;s pretty far out there
but

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.170
it&#39;s actually got interesting,
you know,

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.890
certain merits to it.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.890
I would all call the tactics
that you read about

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.880
here about as sort of minimal
viable transparency.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.240
I actually think you could
push the envelope a lot more.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.790
Steve Jobs tried this at Next.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.710
He actually tried transparent
compensation.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.500
I actually think, although
Next didn&#39;t do extremely well,

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.510
the real reason wasn&#39;t because
of the experiment around

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.220
compensation transparency and

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.160
then there&#39;s a lot of error to
that.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.170
The critique of compensation
transparency is often well.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.410
We want people to be teammates
and

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.480
work together and collaborate.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.240
And if you look in the sports
world, though,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.670
where people are actually
teammates and

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.440
they do have to collaborate,

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.250
all of their compensation is
completely public.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.500
In fact, each of us can look
up anybody&#39;s compensation in

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.320
the sports world and

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.890
get it exactly accurate, and
somehow it seems to work.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.030
So I&#39;m not totally bought in

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.570
to the idea that you need to
keep transpar-,

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.100
compensation non transparent.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.780
Then finally metrics.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.070
So you want to measure things.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.100
You want to measure outputs,
not inputs.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.970
And again, you should dictate
this yourself.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.810
You should draft the dashboard
to tie this all together.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.280
One important concept are what
are known as

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.310
pairing metrics or pairing
indicators,

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.420
which is if you measure one
thing and only one thing.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.640
The company tends to optimize
to that, and often at

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.540
the expense of something else
that&#39;s important.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.190
A costly example in payments
and

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.100
financial service is around
risk.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.300
It&#39;s really easy to give the
risk team an objective and

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.080
say, we want to lower our
fraud rate.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.470
It sounds great.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.470
Until they start treating
every single user in

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.310
this audience as a suspect
user because they

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.540
want to lower their fog rate.

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.100
So they require each of you to
call them up on the phone and

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.720
give them more supplemental
information and

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.860
fax in things and

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.060
you have the lowest fraud rate
in the world,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.300
you also have the worst, you
know,

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.360
sort of customer satisfaction
score.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.780
So what you want to measure at
the same time as

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.780
your fraud rate is your false
positive rate.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.960
That forces the team to
actually innovate.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.700
Similarly, you

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.890
can give recruiters metrics
around hiring, and guess what?

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:44.910
You&#39;ll have a lot of people
come in through interviews,

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.850
but if you&#39;re not tracking the
quality of hires,

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.700
you may be very unhappy with
the quality of people you&#39;re

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.350
interviewing or the people
you&#39;re giving offers to.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.240
So, you always want to create
the opposite as

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.170
an indication and measure
both, and the people that

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.750
are responsible for that team,
need to be measured for both.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.340
Finally around metrics, one
insight I&#39;ve had over my

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.530
career is what you, you kind
of want to look for

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.920
the anomalies.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.940
You don&#39;t actually want to
look for

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.380
the expected behavior.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.150
So that a famous example was
at PayPal.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.580
None of the top ten markets
that

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.300
the company was planning to go
after included eBay.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.440
But one day, someone noticed
that 54 Power Sellers had

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.090
actually handwritten into
their eBay listings,

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.010
please pay me with PayPal, and
brought this to

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.520
the attention of the executive
team at the time.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.100
The first reaction of the
executive team was,

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.060
what the hell&#39;s going on?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.530
Let&#39;s kick them out of the
system.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.409
That&#39;s not our focus.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.300
Fortunately, I think David
Sacks came back the next day

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.970
said, I think we found our
market.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.730
Let&#39;s actually build tools for
these power sellers instead of

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.600
forcing them to write into
their listing,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.530
pay me with PayPal.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.010
Why don&#39;t we have an HTML
button that they can

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.560
just insert?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.430
Well that started to work.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.950
And then he said,

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.660
well actually why do we make
them insert it.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.170
Why should we make them insert
it all the time?

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.700
Why don&#39;t we just

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.090
automatically insert it for
them?

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.360
So they could just insert it
once and

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.770
then every single listing they
have forever.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.590
It&#39;ll just automagically
appear there.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.810
So that became the success for
PayPal.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.360
Similarly, I was at LinkedIn,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.460
and I saw this stat that made
no sense to me.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.920
The UI for the site was a
little bit different back

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.710
then, but 25% of all clicks,
maybe 30% of all clicks

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.490
from the home page were people
going to their own profile.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.290
And that made no sense
whatsoever.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:19.770
I mean like, the set, it was a
settings,

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.920
like you had to literally go
to the right margin.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.730
Final a link and it was 25 to
30% of every single click at

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:28.490
scale I mean so this is like
statistically novel stuff.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:29.590
And it made no sense
whatsoever,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.055
never seen like the UI perform
that way.

00:27:32.055 --> 00:27:35.320
And, I kind of went around for
weeks trying to

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.460
figure this out and then
someone very smart.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.850
Actually, it&#39;s Max Letchin
said something to me and

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.219
I was like, he&#39;s like it&#39;s
vanity.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.190
And I&#39;m like ha people

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:45.720
are looking at themselves in
the mirror.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.940
That&#39;s pretty good answer.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.530
So cause they weren&#39;t editing
their profile.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.280
Nobody has like something to
edit everyday in

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.110
their profile.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.650
But they actually were just
looking in themselves in

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:54.880
the mirror everyday because it
made them feel good.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.870
And then you can actually test
that hypothesis and

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.280
say, well, if I had more
content.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.730
Do I look at myself in the
mirror more often?

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.360
Turns out you did.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.490
If you had more endorsements,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.750
did you look at yourself in
the mirror more often?

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:03.650
Turns out you did.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:04.900
So, we actually figured out
like

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.150
what was actually underneath
utilitarian product that

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.130
the product team thought they
were

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.210
building was actually a lot of
emotional vanity.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.260
They didn&#39;t exactly translate
it to the best possible

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.590
feature, like the PayPal
example,

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.100
which you couldn&#39;t easily put
a button that,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.333
said be more vain today, you
know, on the homepage.

00:28:19.333 --> 00:28:21.077
&gt;&gt; That would probably not
work perfectly, so it

00:28:21.077 --> 00:28:23.570
never really like took off the
way the PayPal example did.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.370
But it clarified what the user
what users of

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.060
the product really wanted and

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.710
we wouldn&#39;t have found that
without looking for

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:30.370
anomalous data.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.882
The final topic I want to talk
about is details.

00:28:33.882 --> 00:28:36.800
And there&#39;s, in my assigned
reading,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.490
there&#39;s a great book I really
like by BIll Walsh called,

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.850
The Score Takes Care of
Itself.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.890
And the basic point of the
book is that if

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.260
you get all the details right,
you don&#39;t worry about how to

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.620
build a billion dollar
business,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.250
how to have $100 million of
revenue,

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.620
how to have a billion users.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.030
That&#39;s a byproduct of getting
all the details of what you

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.760
do everyday to be excellent.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.960
So the example he talks about
in the book that really

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.600
resonated with me was he took
over the 49ers in 1979.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.080
They were the worst team in
football.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.960
I believe they were 2 and 14
the year before,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.240
which is really bad for this,
if you don&#39;t know football.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.140
In the next ten years, he
managed to transform the team

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.100
into the NFL&#39;s best, won three
Super Bowls.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.650
And what&#39;s the first thing he
did to start going from

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.750
a terrible team to the best
team ever in many ways?

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.140
He actually taught the
receptionists how to

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.560
answer the phone properly.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.270
He wrote a three-page memo
about how to

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.370
actually answer the phone.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.940
Now, that may sound absurd.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.670
But his point was, if the
organization as a whole

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.900
does everything exactly the
right way, then receivers, for

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.754
example, will start running
their routes at

00:29:38.754 --> 00:29:41.940
seven-and-a-half yards, not
seven yards, not eight yards.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.290
And that actually will matter.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.530
And then everybody on the team
executes exactly up to

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.270
the same standard of
performance.

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.840
You will have an organization
that is performing at

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.260
the highest possible level,
and

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.060
then with enough random
variation, the highest

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.750
possible performance team will
do the best.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.480
So the way you translate this
to a company are to

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.160
a lotta details that may not
matter.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.110
They may not seem that they
matter superficially.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.390
Most people would agree about
the details matter when it

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:06.740
faces the user.

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.930
But where the real debate is
on

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.220
things that don&#39;t face the
user.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.200
So Steve Jobs famously in the
Mac,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.390
insisted on an immaculate
circuit design board.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.360
You can read about this in
various books.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.130
The Mac, for those of you who
don&#39;t remember the Mac,

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.050
probably everybody here but

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.800
some of you may have seen it,
actually couldn&#39;t be opened.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.190
So the circuit board design
couldn&#39;t be

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.280
seen by any single person in
the world.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.350
There was no way to open the
Mac except the people who

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.420
worked at Apple, and Steve
insisted that it be

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.400
absolutely perfect and
beautiful.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.850
That&#39;s the kind of detail
obsession that this sort of

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.250
philosophy of building a
company requires.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.900
Examples that maybe more
practical for you instead of

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.950
circuit boards are things like
what food do you serve people.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.190
This actually matters more
than you might guess.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.260
When people don&#39;t like the
food you serve them,

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.260
what do they do.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.180
They go gossip.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.260
They go complain to their
friends.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.930
They go walk over to someone&#39;s
desk.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.950
And all the sudden at lunch,

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.770
what they&#39;re complaining about
is, it,

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.450
their mostly spending time
gossiping and

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.410
complaining instead of
brainstorming.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.030
So you don&#39;t have this
serendipitous idea.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.760
Not saying other serendipitous
idea that creates a spark,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.950
instead they&#39;re all wandering
and wallowing around.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.460
So the best thing you could do
is actually give

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.450
people the food they want or
food that&#39;s good for them.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.782
That makes them more
productive.

00:31:09.782 --> 00:31:11.811
So it may seem a lot like this
glorious job

00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:14.080
that you thought you had is
actually more like

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.485
running around being a task
rabbit for people.

00:31:16.485 --> 00:31:17.149
But it&#39;s to

00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:20.147
take the things off the plate
that are a distraction.

00:31:20.147 --> 00:31:22.554
So that they can be
high-performance machines.

00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:25.092
And if you take enough things
away from people that distract

00:31:25.092 --> 00:31:27.323
them and give them the tools
to be successful, all of

00:31:27.323 --> 00:31:29.910
a sudden your organization
produces a lot more.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.240
Similarly, another example
that&#39;s often got wrong is

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:32.930
office space.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.970
So, one natural instinct is
when you need an office is to

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.880
have an office manager or

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.750
someone on your team go out
and find offices.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.424
And they&#39;ll go on tours with
agents and

00:31:41.424 --> 00:31:43.580
they&#39;ll come back with photos
and ideas.

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.040
You need to do that yourself.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.850
The office environment that
people live in and

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.750
work in everyday dictates your
culture and

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.520
how people make decisions, it
dictates how hard people work.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.700
There&#39;s almost no important
more decision other than

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.050
what company you&#39;re going to
be, than what&#39;s the office

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.610
environment you&#39;re actually
in,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.940
and most people don&#39;t do that.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.000
And then the final thing and

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.520
then I&#39;ll take some questions
is around effort.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.820
Ultimately, I don&#39;t believe
that you

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.800
can build a company without a
lot of effort and

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.590
that you&#39;d need to lead by
example.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.290
So Bill Wallace,

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.780
the first chapter of his books
is, get&#39;s asked this question

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.860
of how did you know whether
you&#39;re doing your job?

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.256
And this is the answer he
gives coaches that used to ask

00:32:19.256 --> 00:32:25.960
him that question So if this
is what you

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.015
feel like every day, you&#39;re
probably on the right track.

00:32:28.015 --> 00:32:29.221
And if that doesn&#39;t sound
appetizing,

00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:30.930
you probably shouldn&#39;t start a
company, truthfully.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.010
All right, with that I&#39;m doing
with the prepared part.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.480
Let me see if anybody has
questions I

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.360
can try to be helpful with.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:38.910
Any questions?

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.010
Yes?

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.274
&gt;&gt; So you talked about making
compensation transparent.

00:32:43.274 --> 00:32:47.168
How would you do this,
especially when people equate

00:32:47.168 --> 00:32:51.480
themselves to value, you know,
of how much their salary is?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.030
&gt;&gt; I would, I would do it in,
probably, bands.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.840
because you could do it,

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.850
either just everybody in the
company gets paid the same, or

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:58.120
you could have, like, all
discipline, all engineers, or

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.190
you could do it by experience
like extreme exp.

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.802
The way Steve did it actually
at Next was,

00:33:02.802 --> 00:33:04.195
there was a high band and a
low band.

00:33:04.195 --> 00:33:05.926
And you either had a lot of
experience or

00:33:05.926 --> 00:33:08.602
low experience, and that was
it, so low band back then, you

00:33:08.602 --> 00:33:11.703
know, now it would probably be
like $85,000 kind of everybody

00:33:11.703 --> 00:33:14.804
just flatly gets paid $85,000,
and if your super experienced

00:33:14.804 --> 00:33:17.694
everybody gets paid like
$130,000, and that&#39;s just it

00:33:17.694 --> 00:33:20.095
like this sort of the Next
translated for inflation.

00:33:21.721 --> 00:33:26.331
&gt;&gt; Instead of what&#39;s the how
many details

00:33:27.331 --> 00:33:28.987
&gt;&gt; You&#39;d be amazed.

00:33:28.987 --> 00:33:31.126
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, so the question
was besides food what

00:33:31.126 --> 00:33:33.860
other kind of details do
people care about?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.770
The laptops they use.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.730
I mean, this is now the
default that everybody has.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:39.470
But five years ago,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.890
it was a benefit to give
people high-quality machines

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.620
as opposed to optimizing our
costs and

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:47.580
having Dell machines and ugly
monitors, just as an example.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.200
So if you think about all
these people that

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.490
are relentlessly resourceful,
incredibly talented in

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.150
a massively competitive
ecosystem competing for

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.900
talent, you want to give the
people the best

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.230
possible tools to do the best
possible job.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.950
And so, right rigorously
thinking through how do I

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.510
make people more successful?

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.970
What things do they not need
to be

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:06.010
working on that are
distracting?

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.910
And what things can I

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.760
actually given them that make
them more valuable per day?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.200
And then just break that down
every day and

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.230
solve that stuff yourself.

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.640
&gt;&gt; So, when you&#39;re in a
start-up environment,

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.010
how you you optimize for those
things?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.640
because, you know, resources
are scarce and.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.380
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a good, it&#39;s a good
question.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.770
I actually think that you
should start,

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.840
first of all, you must have
your own office.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.990
I don&#39;t believe ever in shared
office spaces.

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:27.420
Peter talks a little bit about
this,

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.200
that every start-up, every
good start-up is a cult.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.140
It&#39;s really hard to

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.350
create a cult if you&#39;re
sharing space with people.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.290
Because a cult means that you

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.860
think that you&#39;re better than
everybody else in the world,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.770
that you have a special way of
doing

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.680
things that&#39;s different than
everybody else in the world.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.380
And if you&#39;re sharing physical
space with people,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.930
it&#39;s very hard to inculcate
that.

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:43.050
So, I would start there, but

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.420
it is a prioritization
question.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.370
When you have, everybody is

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.240
going to have scarce
resources, just a question of

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.490
magnitude like how many zeros
are you paying attention to?

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:51.873
You know, probably not $10.

00:34:51.873 --> 00:34:53.628
Expenditures, put $100, then
$1,000,

00:34:53.628 --> 00:34:55.980
then 10,000, then a million,
and then 10 million.

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.850
Starts being a rounding error.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.980
So, what I would do is figure
out like,

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.870
what&#39;s most important?

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:02.920
And in a high quality office,
that creates a good vibe.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.500
That allows you to recruit
people,

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.000
because recruits are very
savvy about this.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.420
They walk into your office,
and

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.624
they can tell a lot about the
culture instantly.

00:35:09.624 --> 00:35:12.510
I sometimes, I walk into a
company office and I can tell,

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.360
often, whether I&#39;m going to
invest, as soon as I walk in.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.270
Like, I can absolutely rule
things out that I

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.170
just don&#39;t want to invest in
as soon as I walk in.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.070
And there&#39;s times walking into
the office is like,

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:22.650
wow, this is very impressive.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.230
You can tell how people worked
together,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.720
how hard they&#39;re working, how
distracted they are.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.900
Roelof Botha at Sequoia made a
point to me about YouTube.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.470
So, when I invested in
YouTube,

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.410
in the very, very beginning,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.490
it wasn&#39;t obviously going to
be successful.

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.310
And then, Roelof led this
series A investment for

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.540
Sequoia in YouTube.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.750
And we were at a board meeting
together and he said,

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.090
you know, I think YouTube&#39;s
really going to work.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:45.150
And I said, why?

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.770
And he said well,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.770
every time I go to one of my
portfolio companies,

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:49.740
half the office is watching
YouTube at lunch.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.930
&gt;&gt; And I was like, pretty good
sign.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.710
So like, if you pick up on
these little things you

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:54.340
can predict a lot.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.570
Yeah?

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.580
&gt;&gt; What do you think is the
best way to gain street cred

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:01.640
for a new manager?

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.740
&gt;&gt; Oh boy yeah so the question
is how&#39;s the best way to

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.050
grain, gain street cred for a
new manager?

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.760
Almost all good managers in
Silicon Valley are promoted

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.000
because of their individual
performance in cultures that

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.780
are meritocratic, you know,
the percentage is even higher.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.730
So we tried at PayPal to only
promote people that

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.660
were basically kicking **** at
their discipline.

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.650
So Peter didn&#39;t believe in
general managers.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:27.760
In fact, I remember going for

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.070
a jog around campus within my
first week at PayPal and

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.840
he&#39;s asking me, you know,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.680
how are things going, the
usual kind of CEO questions.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:34.390
And then we got into this

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.490
debate about whether the
company needed any managers.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:37.450
And he&#39;s like, nope.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.430
No managers.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.440
We&#39;re only going to promote
people.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.010
So the VP of Engineering is

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.150
going to be the single best
engineer.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.180
The VP of Design&#39;s going to be
the single best designer.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.840
The VP of Product&#39;s going to
be the single best product

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.970
person and they&#39;re going to
learn to manage later.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.923
And the advantage of that is
you don&#39;t demoralize people,

00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.120
because everybody knows that
their boss actually is

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.190
better at their job than they
are, and they can learn stuff.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:59.400
And you can learn a little bit
of the management techniques

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.530
later as opposed to promoting
people who

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.560
are just good people managers
that don&#39;t actually have

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.350
the discipline and skill, and
that does demoralize people.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.900
So I think, just being
excellent at something, and

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.690
then getting excellent at
getting a bunch of people to

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.014
do something is the next task.

00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:16.870
But people, you just have to
learn,

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:17.920
some things you have to learn
by doing.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.990
You can&#39;t learn to play the
guitar by reading a book.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.070
You&#39;ve actually gotta try to
manage a bit, and

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:22.960
you won&#39;t do it well.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.330
I had another sort of set of
tactics and

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.455
classes on what you actually
do when you transition from

00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:31.040
an individual contributor to a
manager.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.610
It&#39;s hard.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.980
One of the first things people
don&#39;t get right is their time

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.990
allocation.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.040
And so actually, I would
recommend doing what I

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.250
call calendar audit and
tracking for a month what you

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.000
spend your time on and how
much is managing and

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.500
editing, and how much is
writing, et cetera, and

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:46.510
then optimize it over time.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.430
You can get a mentor, find
somebody who&#39;s been a manager

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:52.890
before that will work with
you, not your boss.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.910
Because your boss has a set
complicated objectives,

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.810
including how much are we
shipping?

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.520
A mentor can just focus on
you, and

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520
making you more successful.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.550
&gt;&gt; Can you give some more
examples of things you can

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.040
do which show a consistent
voice of the company,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.450
especially with the company
growing?

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:10.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.920
so, I would look at every
piece of

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.510
copy in every department.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.530
So like another area that
almost never is a done.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.720
So look at your recruiting
website.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.420
Almost never done to

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.010
the same quality as your
conversion funnel.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.300
I look at customer support,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.270
another classic area that
isn&#39;t up to the same quality,

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.710
and treat customer support
like a product.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.260
So that you actually have an
engineering team and

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.770
a design team over time,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.460
that actually focuses on
making that world-class.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.540
Usually, where you have
different executives at

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.960
a scaled company, most
executives were

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.460
trained differently at
different companies, and

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.490
they bring some of that with
them.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.770
So you&#39;ve got to cross train
that.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.000
So, if you&#39;ve hired a VP of
Engineering from Google.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.350
It&#39;s very different than a
design leader who

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:47.100
came from Apple,

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.120
they don&#39;t actually learn how
to do anything the same way.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.520
So you&#39;re going to have to
stitch that together somehow,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.090
either one or the other is
going to have to learn in

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.330
the other style or you&#39;re
going to have to create your

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:58.450
own style and really teach
that to your executives.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.970
So it shows up all the time
but

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.270
all you do, all you need to do
is just pick up the company&#39;s

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:04.910
products and look for things
that have a different voice.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:05.520
And you can see it.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.960
Visual voice, word choice,
all, all over the map.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.430
Sam?

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.940
&gt;&gt; Could you talk a little bit
about the tactics of how

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.675
you manage people?

00:39:14.675 --> 00:39:19.890
Like how you
&gt;&gt; So the canonical advice

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.720
in this now sounds obvious but
actually was

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.370
pretty radical in 1982 when
Andy wrote his first book is

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.640
you should have a one on one
roughly every two weeks.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.030
Some people say every week,

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.530
and I don&#39;t think you want to
go longer than two weeks,

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:34.350
one week can be ideal actually
in many companies.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.770
The reason why in fact there&#39;s
ano, another adage which is,

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.100
you should only have five to
seven direct reports.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.030
That actually derives from the
concept of a one on one

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.140
every week.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.030
So that the direct reports, so
you can fit enough one on ones

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.160
in your calendar and still get
other things done.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.810
So I think one on one&#39;s per
week are a good idea.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.460
The agenda should be crafted
by the employee who reports to

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.960
the manager, not the manager.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.550
The one on one is mostly for

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.500
the benefit of the employee,
so they should walk in with,

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.660
here&#39;s the three or four
things I want to talk about.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.980
Ideally, they circulate that.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.230
It can be even bullet points
in advance by email.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.920
But, in advance you have time
to chew on it and

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.840
you&#39;re not on the fly, winging
your responses.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.750
But that&#39;s probably the best
structure.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.690
Now if someone&#39;s really good
and really talented and

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:15.530
has been doing something for

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.750
a long time with a lot of
internal credibility,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.510
you might push out the one
every week, and

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.350
relax that to one every two
weeks, possibly once a month.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.778
I don&#39;t know that I would go
beyond once a month ever.

00:40:24.778 --> 00:40:27.329
&gt;&gt; When is it acceptable to
compromise and

00:40:27.329 --> 00:40:31.480
hire someone who is ammunition
rather than a barrel?

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question is
when,

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:33.931
when do you compromise and

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.280
hire more ammunition instead
of a barrel?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.260
Truthfully, you&#39;re going to
hire more ammunitions by

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.070
definition than you are
barrels.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.910
So there&#39;s a ratio between the
two.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.610
The question is the ratio.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.830
So at some point the ratio is
going to get out of wack.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.340
So if you&#39;re the only barrel
in the company and

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.760
you have 50 engineers, you
might as well only have ten

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.590
engineers because you&#39;re not
going to get anymore done.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:52.820
So you&#39;re just wasting
resources.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.940
You&#39;re going to have
frustrated engineers,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.860
because everybody&#39;s going to
need your approval,

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.180
your sign off, your editing.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.890
It&#39;s just going to stack and
frustrate people.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.520
So, it&#39;s really, now different
disciplines, engineering,

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.860
like I actually think like
roughly one to ten to 20 is

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.390
probably about the right
range.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.130
Like you don&#39;t need more
engineers until you

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:14.640
have more barrels.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.940
Designers a little different,

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.590
but it&#39;s always going to be
hiring more ammunitions.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.080
And a good leader,

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.290
a good barrel will kind of
have a feel for that.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.680
So one way to, one way to
correct for this.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.000
Natural tendency is to
increase that your headcount

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.470
on your team, like sort of an
empire building tendency.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.053
Like, oh so I manage 20
people, and

00:41:32.053 --> 00:41:33.940
Sam only manages ten, and you
manage three.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.078
So, I&#39;m more important than
Sam and

00:41:35.078 --> 00:41:36.153
you&#39;re more important than
you.

00:41:36.153 --> 00:41:37.782
One way to do that is you put
an X here of

00:41:37.782 --> 00:41:40.623
the number of people that the,
the output, sorry, specify how

00:41:40.623 --> 00:41:43.043
many things they&#39;ve done
successfully then divide by

00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:45.619
the number of people on their
team, and tell them that this

00:41:45.619 --> 00:41:48.118
is going to be their grade in
their performance review.

00:41:48.118 --> 00:41:51.129
Shockingly this y doesn&#39;t
start increasing on that team.

00:41:51.129 --> 00:41:52.530
It&#39;s amazing how this works.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.211
And be really explicit about
it.

00:41:56.211 --> 00:41:58.015
&gt;&gt; As, venture capitalist,

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:01.000
how often you intervene this
and, what&#39;s.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.480
&gt;&gt; So how often do I meet
with?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.145
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
How you.

00:42:05.145 --> 00:42:06.420
[CROSS-TALK].
&gt;&gt; So the question is,

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.370
as a venture capitalist,

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.300
how often do I interact with
my companies, meet with them.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.290
Generally when we invest and
we do,

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:15.950
do some seed investments where
we invest less money but

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.510
when we invest a fair amount
of money and

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.410
lead a round like a series a a
series b round

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.220
we join the board, and roughly
I meet with

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.590
the founder CEO every two
weeks, that&#39;s the default.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.870
Now there can be obviously
there&#39;s inflection moments and

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.390
things go right well or wrong.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.740
And, you know, that&#39;s on an
ad-hoc basis.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.510
These days, actually,

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.080
surprisingly, I do a lot by
text message.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:39.270
I even have one CEO who
Snapchats me all the time.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.300
Which I&#39;d actually rather not,
but, That, so.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.540
The world, the world has
changed a lot.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.980
But I try in-person meetings
every two weeks.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.430
&gt;&gt; Are you the no.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.850
I mean, really it&#39;s,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.220
like, being a venture
capitalist is more,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.320
to me, like being a
psychologist.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:56.940
So if you come to

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.620
my office you&#39;ll see actually
we have two chairs,

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.840
kind of arrayed like this with
a little table in the middle.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:01.530
And we sit down.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.730
And I&#39;m basically, like, so
tell me your problems.

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:04.560
You know?
[LAUGHTER] Then,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.750
it&#39;s like a question.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.670
It&#39;s like, so have you.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.030
And then the, and then my
response is usually,

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.960
well have you thought about
this?

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.860
Have you talked to this
person?

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.890
Have you tried this?

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.460
Et cetera.
And it&#39;s just asking a lot of

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.730
questions and going back that
way.

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.150
But that&#39;s 90% of what I do.

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.000
So I see when you, when you&#39;ve
got these barrels,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.580
you say your starter company
is up doing really good,

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.940
you know, and you&#39;re working
on this project.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.840
I&#39;ve heard that you should
always be recruiting.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; How do you,

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.060
how do you balance that.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.040
Well it depends on where your
prioritizations are.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.620
So you know, Sam talked a
little bit

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.510
about this in his lecture,

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:39.710
but every company will move
recruiting you know, first,

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.630
second, or third somewhere in
that sort of spectrum.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.540
If it&#39;s your number one
priority then about 25% is

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:47.560
probably a pretty good
allocation.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.310
Actually I like the calendar
audit for

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.490
CEO&#39;s even more, so than for
new managers.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.120
So when I work with CEO&#39;s
sometimes who aren&#39;t.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.250
Thriving in that role for the
first time.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.670
Actually forced them to show
me their calendar.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.720
And before I do that, and now
I&#39;m going to ruin this trick

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.190
because if I tell it to you,
actually asked them to

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:05.980
write their priorities, write
them down on a piece of paper.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.140
And, you know, discuss
whatever they are.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.700
Then we go pull up their
calendar, and

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.410
see if it matches.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:11.660
And it never matches.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.340
They, never.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.790
They, recruiting is the one
that&#39;s most often.

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.300
Awry so you know, let&#39;s say
half the CEO&#39;s you meet with

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.300
will say recruiting&#39;s the
number one priority.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.540
It&#39;s almost never the biggest
block of

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.660
time on anybody&#39;s calendar,
and so

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:25.400
that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to
do is match resources and

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.210
inputs against priorities, and
a calendar audit unfortunately

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.160
there&#39;s no software that does
this really well.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.850
It would be great.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.430
Like actually the,

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.630
we literally pull up someone&#39;s
Google calendar and

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.430
kind of manually add up the
hours.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.560
Which in, somewhat insane.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.000
But that&#39;s, that&#39;s the best
way is just,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.970
well what are your priorities.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.080
If your priorities are raising
money, you

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.890
don&#39;t want to allocate 100% of
your time for recruiting.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.010
You want to allocate a fair
amount of time to raising

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.508
money for that block of time
until you&#39;re successful at it.

00:44:47.508 --> 00:44:50.650
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.900
&gt;&gt; One more question anybody,
okay, go ahead.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.570
&gt;&gt; On the surface some of the
advice students contradictory

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.690
because you emphasized
focusing on a plus pass, and

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.560
delegating less important
things, but then you said it&#39;s

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.290
good to write like few page
script for your receptors.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.200
Focus on all the details.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.800
How do you harmonize those
goals?

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.540
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a good question.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.630
I think the way to harmonize.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.690
The question is really, how do
you harmonize things like,

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.490
where details can really
matter but

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.460
you only get one thing, you
know, to do and

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.720
you&#39;ve gotta allocate to the
top one, two, or three things.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.840
How do you, how do you put
those two things together?

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.120
And actually there is some
tension in, even in a healthy

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.510
organization, there&#39;s some
tension of like why are we

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.210
actually focused on, you know,
writing the script.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.570
As opposed to something a user
may see.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.700
I think the underlying
philosophy of

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.560
getting the details right is
pretty important to

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.830
install in the very, very,
very beginning of

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.910
a company because people will
start acting that way and

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.930
making decisions that way
themselves.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.970
So, you won&#39;t have to actually
literally do that.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.970
And if you have to do that, it
actually shows you

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.620
that the foundation isn&#39;t
actually that, that solid.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.730
So eh, when you first start
the company.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.760
It&#39;s about getting the details
right,

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.230
that everybody is precise,

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.490
everybody on every task is
always thinking that way.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.550
And then that scales, and

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.880
then the people you bring in,
it&#39;s a little self-fulfilling,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.620
people who can think that way
will tend to get hired,

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.350
people who can&#39;t won&#39;t get
hired.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.060
Each team, and

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.240
each leader, will tend to
enforce that themselves,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:10.200
to see whose almost never
doing it.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.050
So, it&#39;s partially, like,

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:13.050
how do you start, and at
cultures like that,

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.230
I mean, the, key to culture is
it&#39;s a rule.

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.810
It&#39;s a frame work for making
decisions.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.900
And if you have a cultured
people learn how to

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.610
make decisions across that
culture and

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:25.520
you&#39;re never day anything,
except just yeah watch.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.150
And you know and promote and
move people around.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.040
Cool, well I guess that&#39;s it,
thank you.

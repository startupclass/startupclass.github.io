WEBVTT

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:00.780
Thank you for coming.

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.194
>> Move us all, thank you.

00:00:02.194 --> 00:00:04.489
Cool, so you guys this is
awesome,

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:07.326
I've been watching the
lectures in this course,

00:00:07.326 --> 00:00:09.840
isn't it absolutely amazing
the content?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.087
And now you're stuck with me
today.

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.429
>> We'll, so how that goes.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.376
Unlike Paul, when he was
talking in the Q and A,

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:19.323
and you guys asked him what
he would do if he was at

00:00:19.323 --> 00:00:20.055
college today and

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.030
he said physics, I actually
indulged myself.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.730
I went in, I went and did
physics,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.019
did physics at Cambridge and
I think physics is

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.661
an amazing class to give you
transferable skills that

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.380
are really useful in other
areas.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.960
But I guess that's not,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.760
that's not why you're
listening to me today.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.660
Like, physics isn't the
class, like, so I paid for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.590
college doing online
marketing.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.030
Direct sales marketing.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.650
I started with SEO in the
1990s.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.830
I created a paper airplane
site.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.250
I had a monopoly.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.180
In the small niche market of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.890
paper airplanes globally
which you know,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.250
when you want to start a
startup also see how big

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.660
the market could be in the
long term it wasn't great.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810
But what that taught me was
how to do SEO.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.860
And back in those days it
was Altavista, and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.720
the way to do SEO was to
have white text on

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.650
a white background five
pages below the fold.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.700
And you would rank top of
Alta Vista if you just paper

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.010
airplanes 20 or 30 times in
that text.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.220
And that was how you won at
SEO in the 1990s.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.350
Like it was a really easy,
easy skill to learn.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.840
When I went to college,
being a physicist,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.580
I thought paper airplanes
would make me cool, and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.920
I was actually the most
nerdy person in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.230
the physics class, so I
created a cocktail site.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.050
Which was how I learned to
program.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.840
And that grew to be the
largest cocktail site in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.210
the UK.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.990
And that really got me into
SEO properly when

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.130
Google launched.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.070
So with Google, you had to
worry about page rank, and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.220
you had to worry about
getting links

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.810
back to your site.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.010
Which basically, at that
stage,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.260
meant one link from the
Yahoo directory.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.750
Got you to the top listing
in Google if you had white

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630
text, on a white background,
below the fold, as well.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.520
When Google launched AdWords
that's when I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.260
really started to learn how
to do all my marketing.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.220
And that was buying paid
clicks from Google, and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.480
reselling them to eBay for

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.970
a small margin of like 20%
using our affiliate program.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.530
And that was what really
kicked me into overdrive

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.890
into doing what everyone
nowadays talks about is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370
growth, or growth hacking,
or growth marketing.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.100
And in my mind it's just
internet marketing.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.080
Using whatever channel you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.800
can to get whatever output
you want.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.820
And that's how I paid for
college and how I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.430
ended up going from being a
physicist to a marketer and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.110
transitioning to the dark
side of the force.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.480
So what do you think matters
most for growth.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.870
You've had loads of lectures
and

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.260
people have said it over and
over, so

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.970
what do you guys think
matters most for growth?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.380
Someone give me an answer.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.090
>> Great product.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.750
>> Great product.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.820
I agree, great product.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.350
What does great product lead
to?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.060
>> Customers.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.640
>> Customers.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.466
And what do you need those
customers to do?

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:41.058
>> Spread the word.

00:02:41.058 --> 00:02:43.250
Someone said stay on your
site.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.010
Someone said that.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.530
That's it.
Retention.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.450
Retention is the single most
important thing for growth.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390
Now we have an awesome
growth team at Facebook, and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.900
I'm super proud to work on
it.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.400
But the truth of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.230
the matter is we have a
fantastic product.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.000
But getting to work on
growth at Facebook is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.570
a massive privilege, because
we're promoting something

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.430
that everyone in the world
really wants to use.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.690
Which is absolutely
incredible.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.110
If we can get people on, and

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.740
get them ramped up, they
stick on Facebook.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.810
So many times I go advise
multiple startups,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.460
my favorite was working with
Airbnb, but

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.980
I've worked with Coursera,
I've worked with

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.550
other ones that haven't done
as well as those guys.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.990
But the one thing that is
true over, and over, and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.850
over again is if you look at
this curve.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.050
The sentiment, the active,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.890
versus number of days from
acquisition.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.140
If you end up with a
retention curve that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.080
ascentotes to a line
parallel to the x axis.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.560
You have a viable business,
and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.080
you have product market fit
for some subset of market.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.790
But most of the companies
that you see fly up,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.780
we talk about growth hacking
and virality and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.860
all of this other stuff.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.960
I'm gonna try so hard not to
swear, but it'll happen.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.480
Their attention curve slopes
down towards the X-axis, and

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.620
in the end intercepts the
X-axis.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.040
Now when I show this chart
to

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.720
most people they say that's
all well and good.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.290
You had a million people a
day in terms of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.500
growth when you started the
growth team at Facebook, or

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.320
you were at 50 million
users.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.950
You had a lot of people
joining the site so

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.280
you had a ton of data to do
this.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.280
We used this same
methodology for

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.720
our B to B growth.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.040
Getting people to sign up as
self-service advertisers,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.300
we used this analysis to
understand how much

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.070
growth we were gonna have in
that market as well.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.140
And in that place,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.180
when I joined Facebook, the
product was three days old.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.020
And within 90 days of the
product launching,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.990
we were able to use this
technique to be able to

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.600
figure out what the one year
value of an advertiser was,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.880
and we predicted it for the
first year to 97% of

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.460
what the number turned out
to be.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.880
So I think it's very
important to look at

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.730
your attention curve, and
this is how we did it.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.520
If you see here.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.420
This red line is number of
users,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.560
who have been on your
product for

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.520
a certain number of days.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.090
So, a bunch of people, that
should say zero,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.180
a bunch of people will have
been on your product,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.900
all of your users will have
been on it at least one day.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.300
But, if your product's been
around a year, or whatever,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.940
you will have zero users
who've been on it 366 days.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.530
Make sense?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.480
The curves sensible?

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.870
Cool.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.400
So what you then do is look
for all of your users,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.450
who have been on your
product one day.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.440
What percentage of them are
monthly active.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.610
100% for the first 30 days
obviously,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.360
because monthly active they
all signed up on one day.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.150
But then you look at 31.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.920
Every single user, on their
31st day after registration,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.910
what percentage of them were
monthly active, 32nd day,

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.910
33rd day, 34th day?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.030
And that allows you,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.120
with only something like
10,000 customers or

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.050
whatever, to get a real idea
of what this curve is

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.630
gonna look like for your
product.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.738
And you're gonna be able to
tell does it asymptote.

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:47.670
And it'll get noisy out
towards the right-hand side.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.270
Like I'm not using real
data.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.980
It'll get noisy out towards
the right hand side, but

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.820
you'll be able to get a
handle on,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.280
does this curve flatten out
or does it not.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.100
If it doesn't flatten out,
don't go and

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.500
do growth tactics, don't go
and

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.950
do virality, don't hire a
growth hacker.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.840
Focus on getting product
market fit.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.600
Because in the end,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.780
as Sam said in the beginning
of this course,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.610
idea, product, team,
execution.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.980
If you don't have a great
product,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.070
there's no point executing
well on growing it.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.760
Because it won't grow.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.240
Number one problem I've seen
inside Facebook for

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.550
new products, number one
problem I've seen for

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.590
startups I ever devised has
been, they don't actually

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.360
have product market fit when
they think they do.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.000
So the next obvious question
that people ask over and

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.450
over and over again is okay,
so

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.010
what does good retention
look like?

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.200
Sure I can have five percent
retention but

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.020
I'm guessing that Facebook
had better than that, so

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.090
that's not gonna be a
successful business.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.240
And I get really pissed off
when

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.220
people ask me that question.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.610
Because I think you can
figure it out.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.620
And I love this story, and
this is like my one

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.860
gratuitous story that I love
that I'm throwing in here,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.950
so the rest of it may not be
as gratuitous.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.870
But this is a picture that
was published in

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.120
Life magazine in 1950 of

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.210
one of the Trinity nuclear
bomb tests.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.210
And there's a guy,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.740
Geoffrey Taylor, who's heard
of Geoffrey Taylor.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.850
Awesome.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.370
Yes.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.450
Someone's heard of him.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.200
Geoffrey Taylor was a
British physicist,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.490
who ended up actually
winning the Nobel Prize.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.490
And he was able to figure
out from looking at

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.440
this picture, what the power
of the atomic bomb was,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.610
the U.S. atomic bomb.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.800
And Russian's were
publishing similar pictures,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.720
just using dimensional
reasoning.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.820
And dimensional reasoning is
I think,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.690
one of the best skills that
I learned during my

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.260
time studying physics back
in the U.K..

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.780
And what dimensional
reasoning is, is you look at

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.690
the dimensions that are
involved in a problem.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.210
So, you wanna figure out
energy?

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.310
Newtons, meters, newtons are
kilograms, meters are second

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.060
to the minus 2, so you've
got kilograms,

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.570
meters squared, seconds to
the minus 2,

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.850
and then you try and figure
out how you can get each of

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.430
those numbers from what data
you have.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.280
So, the mass.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.620
Is the volume of this
sphere.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.950
So, that's a meter cubed you
throw in there.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.590
So you've got meters the 5
over seconds the minus 2,

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.300
and he was able to use that
to just figure out

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.200
what the power of this
atomic bomb was,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.030
what the ratios of the power
between the Russian and

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.230
US atomic bomb, and
essentially reveal one of

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.400
the top secrets that existed
in the world at that time.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.160
That's a hard problem.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.790
Figuring out what

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.130
Facebook's retention rate is
not a hard problem.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.140
How many people are there on
the internet?

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.823
Give or take someone throw
something out.

00:08:19.823 --> 00:08:21.380
>> 2.4 billion, 2.3 billion.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.630
Something like that right?

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.320
Okay, Facebook's banned in
China.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.310
So.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.810
What now?

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.230
>> About a billion.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.250
>> About 2 billion?

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.440
2 billion.
So

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.760
2 billion people on the
internet.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.030
Facebook in their last
earnings call

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.620
said something around 1.3
billion in

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.830
terms of the number of
active users.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.550
You can divide those numbers
by each other.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.330
And yeah, that won't give
you the right answer.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.780
Course it's not gonna give
you the right answer.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.450
But it's gonna give you

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.250
close enough to a ballpark
figure.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.540
Of what the retention rate
looks like for Facebook.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.510
If we signed everyone on the
internet up, and

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.650
then you will know it is
higher than that.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.610
Similarly if you look at
Whats App, they've announced

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.550
six hundred million active
users.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.700
How many people have smart
phones?

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.800
You can figure out that
number.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.490
That number is out knocking
around.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.180
It can give an idea of how
many users there are.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.230
Amazon has had a pop at

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.720
signing up almost everyone
in the United States.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.930
You know how many people are
online in the US, and

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.940
you've got a good idea of
how many

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.030
customers Amazon are from
the numbers they throw out.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.300
Different verticals need
different terminal retention

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.580
rates for them to have
successful businesses.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.610
If you're in e-commerce and
you're retaining on

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.160
a monthly active basis like
20, 30% of your users,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.340
you're probably gonna do
pretty well.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.560
If you're in social media,
and

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.260
your first batch of people
signing up to

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.850
your product are not like
80% retained,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.630
you're not gonna have a
massive social media site.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.920
And so, it really depends on
the vertical you're in,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.540
what the retention rates
are.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.450
What you need to do is have
the tools to

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.690
think about who out there is
comparable.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.377
And how you can look at it
and say,

00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:50.030
am I anywhere close to what
real success looks like in

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.888
this vertical?

00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:54.429
So retention is

00:09:54.429 --> 00:09:57.370
the single most important
thing for growth.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.150
And retention comes from
having a great idea, and

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.030
a great product to back up
that idea and

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.960
great product market fit.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.530
The way we look at whether a
product has great retention

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.490
or not is whether or not the
users who install it.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.420
Actually stay on it long
term,

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.640
when you normalize on a
cohort basis, and

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.440
I think that's a really good
methodology for

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.100
looking at your product and
saying, okay, the first 100,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.690
the first 1,000, the first
10,000 people I get on this,

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.400
will they be retained in the
long run?

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.240
So now how do you attack
operating for growth?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.730
Let's say you have awesome
product market fit.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.240
You have built an e-commerce
site and you have 60% of

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.230
people coming back every
single month and

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.260
making a purchase from you.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.790
Which would be absolutely
fantastic.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.650
How do you take that and say
now it's time to scale?

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.640
Now it's time to

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.240
execute was the last thing
in your thought.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:47.920
Right?

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.330
And that's where I think
growth teams come in.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.280
Like my contrarian
viewpoint, or

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.740
whatever is if you're a
start-up you

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.890
shouldn't have a growth
team.

00:10:56.937 --> 00:10:58.304
>> Damn it.

00:10:58.304 --> 00:10:59.900
So close.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.670
Halfway through and I
failed.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.045
You shouldn't have a growth
team.

00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:07.220
Start-ups should not have
growth teams.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.020
The whole company should be
the growth team.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.280
The CEO.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.610
Should be the head of
growth.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.620
You need someone to set a
North Star for

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.910
you, gratuitous shot of the,
you know, NASA page.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.930
You need someone to set a
North Star for

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.920
you about where the company
wants to go.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.240
And that person needs to be
the person leading

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.630
the company, in my opinion,
from what I've seen.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.420
And Mark is a fantastic
example of that.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.490
Back when Facebook started
lots of people were

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.840
putting out their registered
user numbers.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.020
Right?
You'd see registered user

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:36.770
numbers for MySpace.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.120
You'd see registered user
numbers for Compact.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.040
You'd see registered user
numbers.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.430
Mark put out monthly active
users as the number both

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.410
internally he held everyone
to.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.180
And said we need everyone on
Facebook, but

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.060
that means everyone active
on Facebook.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.770
Not everyone signed up to
Facebook.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.640
So monthly active people was
the number internally.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.650
And it was also the number
he published externally.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.120
It was the number he made
the whole world hold

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.860
Facebook to as the number
that we cared about.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.960
If you look at what Yam has
done with What's Up I

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.710
think it's another great
example.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.140
He always published send
numbers.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.490
If you're a messaging
application,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:11.120
sends is probably the single
most important number.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.030
If people use you once a
day.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.420
Maybe that's great, but they
send one message.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.510
They, you're not really
their primary messaging

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.190
mechanism, so Yan published
the sentence number.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.770
Right?

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:25.180
Inside AvianB they talk
about nice book, and

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.540
they also published that in
all of the,

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.740
like, infographics that you
see inside Tech Crunch.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.250
They always benchmark
themselves against how many

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.970
nights booked they

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.440
have compared to the largest
hotel chains in the world.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.420
They have, each of these
companies,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.080
a different north star.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.350
The north start doesn't have
to be

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.850
monthly active users for
every different vertical.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.920
For eBay, when I was there,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.230
it was gross merchandised
volume.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.320
How much stuff did people
actually buy through eBay.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.640
Everyone externally tends to
judge eBay based on revenue.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640
Actually, Benedict Evans has

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.870
done this amazing breakdown
of Amazon's business.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.890
Which is really interesting.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.700
To look at their marketplace
business versus their

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.790
direct business.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.020
EBay is all marketplace
business, right.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.760
So eBay's being judged by
its revenue when it

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.010
actually has ten times, or
whatever more

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.610
gross merchandised volume
going through the site.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.590
And that was the number that
eBay looked at when I

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.540
was inside there, and
optimized for.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.970
So every different company
when it

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.970
thinks about growth needs a
different north star.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.550
But when you are operating
for

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.310
growth, it is critical that
you have that north star and

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.370
you define it as a leader.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.440
The reason this matters is.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.020
The second you have more
than one person working on

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.600
anything, you cannot control
what everyone else is doing.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.270
Right?

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:36.940
I promise you,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.450
having now might have hit
100 people I'm managing,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.960
I have no control.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.560
It's all influence.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.820
Yes, I can say to one
person, do this one thing.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.420
But then the other 99

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.090
are gonna do whatever the
hell they want.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.090
And the thing is, it's not
clear to everybody what

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.470
the most important thing is
a for a company.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.010
It would be very easy inside
eBay for

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.070
people to say, you know
what?

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.250
We should focus on revenue.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.921
Or you know what?
We should focus on

00:14:03.921 --> 00:14:04.928
the number of people buying
from us.

00:14:04.928 --> 00:14:05.901
Or you know what?
We should focus on

00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:06.873
how many people list items
on eBay.

00:14:06.873 --> 00:14:08.880
And Pierre and Meg and John.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.460
Those guys, those various
leaders, always said no,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.160
it's the amount of gross
merchandise volume that

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960
goes through our site.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.895
It's the percentage of

00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:17.740
e-commerce that goes through
our site.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.402
That is what really matters
for this company.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.420
Which means when people are
having a conversation and

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.220
you're not in the room, when
they're sitting in front of

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.410
their computer screen and
thinking about how they

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:27.690
build this particular
product or

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.140
this particular feature.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.980
In their head,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.290
it's gonna be clear to them
that it's not about revenue.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.270
It's about gross merchandise
volume.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.250
Or it's not about getting
more registrations.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.300
Registrations don't matter
unless they become long term

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.940
active users.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.480
A great example of this is
when I was at Ebay in 2004.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.933
We changed the way we paid
our affiliates for

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:50.874
new users.

00:14:50.874 --> 00:14:53.822
And affiliate programs are a
bit out of fashion these

00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:54.425
days, but

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:57.307
the idea of an affiliate
program is essentially you

00:14:57.307 --> 00:14:58.925
pay anyone on the internet.

00:14:58.925 --> 00:15:02.246
A referral for sending
traffic to your site.

00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:04.384
But it's mostly about
getting access to like,

00:15:04.384 --> 00:15:06.041
big marketers who do it on
their own,

00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:06.950
like separately and

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.550
some really good stories
from this.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.480
We were paying for confirmed
registered users.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.282
So all of our affiliates
were aligned,

00:15:15.282 --> 00:15:18.360
they're out getting
confirmed registered users,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.370
to the base site.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.910
We changed our payment model
to pay for

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.470
activated confirmed
registered users.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.440
So you had to confirm your
account and

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.150
then bid on an item, or buy
an item or

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:34.170
list an item, to become
someone that we paid for.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.080
Overnight when we made that
change,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.160
we lost something like 20%
of confirmed registered

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.090
users that were being driven
by the affiliates.

00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:47.816
But the ACIUs only dropped
by about 5%.

00:15:47.816 --> 00:15:50.427
The ratio of CIU to ACIU
went up, and

00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:54.270
then the growth of ACIUs,
massively accelerated.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.200
The cause of this was if you
wanna drive CRUs if

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.030
someone searches for

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.680
a trampoline, you land them
on the registration page cuz

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.100
they think they have to
register and

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.150
confirm, before they get
that trampoline.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.855
If you wanna drive ACRUs you
land them on the search

00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:12.210
results page within eBay for
trampolines so they can see

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.970
the thing they want to buy,
get excited about it and

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.170
register when they want to
buy it.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.480
And if you drive just CRUs
people don't

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.350
have an amazing,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.930
magic moment on eBay when
they visit the site.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.600
And that's the next most
important thing to

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.220
think about, is how do you
drive towards the magic

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.590
moment that gets people
hooked on your service?

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.010
So in the lecture notes for

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.350
this course I've stuck in a
bunch of links to people I

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.470
think are brilliant at all
of this stuff.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.450
That retention curve I
showed earlier,

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.650
there's a link to this guy
Danny Ferrante

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.650
whose incredible talking
about retention curves.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.716
The magic moment, there are
two videos linked.

00:16:46.716 --> 00:16:49.400
One is Chimoff talking about
growth,

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.820
who was the guy who set up
the growth team at Facebook.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.614
And one is my friend Naomi
and

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.857
I talking at F8 four years
ago about how we

00:16:55.857 --> 00:16:57.986
were thinking about growth
back then.

00:16:57.986 --> 00:16:59.267
And in both of those mem,

00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:02.480
both of those videos we talk
about the magic moment.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.390
So, what do you guys think
the magic moment is for

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.560
when you're signing up to
Facebook?

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.080
You hit that big green
button,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.124
what is the moment when
users are like ha?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.730
Mark even talked about it at
the start up

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:13.820
school a few years back.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:14.680
>> See your friends.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.610
>> See your friends.

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.060
Simple as that.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.400
And usually it is very
simple.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.670
I talked to so many
companies, and they try and

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.180
get incredibly complicated
about what they're doing.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.560
But it is as simple as just
when you see that

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.460
first picture of one of your
friends on Facebook.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.300
You go, oh my God, this is
what the site is about.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.573
And Zucks talked at Y
Combinator about

00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:36.340
getting people to ten
friends in 14 days.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.760
That is why we focus on that
metric.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.520
The number one most
important thing in

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.270
a social media site is
connecting to your friends.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.085
Because without that,

00:17:44.085 --> 00:17:45.650
you have a completely empty
news feed, and

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.100
clearly you're not gonna
come back.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.420
You'll never get any
notifications,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.770
you'll never have any
friends telling you

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.660
about things they're missing
on the site.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.640
So for Facebook the magic
moment is that moment when

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.100
you see your friend's face,
and

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.580
everything we do on growth.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.330
And if you look at the
LinkedIn registration flow,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.850
or you look at the Twitter
registration flow,

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.320
or you look at what WhatsApp
does when you sign up,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.080
the number one thing all
these services look to

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.550
do is to show you the people
you want to follow,

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.540
connect to, send messages
to, as quickly as possible.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.339
Because in this vertical,
that's what matters.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.990
When you think about Airbnb
or you think about eBay,

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.750
it's finding on eBay that
unique item,

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.000
that PEZ dispenser or broken
laser pointer that you

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.930
really, really cared about,
and wanted to get hold of.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.530
Like when you see that
collectible thing that you

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.000
were missing, that is the
real magic moment on eBay.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.370
When you look on Airbnb and

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.150
you find that first, you
find that,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.750
that first listing that's
like a cool house that you

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.360
can stay in and

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.660
when you go through the
door, that's a magic moment.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.800
And similarly on the other
side,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.000
when you're listing your
house,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.660
the first time you get paid,
is an amazing moment.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.880
When you're listing an item
on eBay,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.860
the first time you get paid
is a magic moment.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.410
You should ask Brian what he
thinks,

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.613
cuz they've done these
amazing storyboards which I

00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:53.765
think has been shared, of
like the journey through

00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:56.338
a user's moment on life on,
on Airbnb and how excited.

00:18:56.338 --> 00:18:58.300
Isn't, he's talking in three
lectures time?

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.980
The guy's awesome at talking
about the magic moment and

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.410
getting his users to feel
love and

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.980
joy and all this stuff.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.600
So think about what the
magic moment is for

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.870
your product, and

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.830
get people connected to it
as fast as possible.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.440
Because then you

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.000
can move up where that blue
line has asymptoted.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.832
Then you can go from 50%
retention to 60% retention

00:19:15.832 --> 00:19:18.782
to 70% retention easily, if
you can connect people with

00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:21.030
the thing that makes them
stick on your site.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.600
The second thing to think
about is everyone in

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.380
the Valley gets wrong, that
we optimize when we

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.050
think about growth for
ourselves.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.060
So my favorite example is
notifications.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.020
Again, talk to lots of
companies, advise lots of

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.900
companies, every single
company when they

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.190
talk about notifications,
goes, oh I'm getting too

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.890
many notifications, I think
that's what we

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.830
need to optimize for in
notifications.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.998
Okay, are your power users
leaving your site

00:19:48.998 --> 00:19:51.093
because they're getting too
many notifications?

00:19:51.093 --> 00:19:53.122
No, then why would you
optimize that,

00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:55.960
they're probably grownups
and they can use filters.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.850
What you need to focus on is
the marginal user.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.760
The one person who doesn't
get a notification in

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.360
a given day, or month, or
year.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.070
Our experience of our
products, and

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.740
by the way like building an
awesome product is

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.120
all about thinking about the
power user, right?

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.360
Building an incredible
product

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.800
is definitely optimizing for

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.870
the people who use your
product the most.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.350
But driving growth,

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.210
people who are already using
your product all the time,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.500
are not the ones you have to
worry about.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.783
So, in this Danny Ferrante
video there's also this link

00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:28.733
from the lecture page,

00:20:28.733 --> 00:20:31.063
there's also talk about our
growth accounting framework

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.601
that we use to think about
for growth.

00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:35.067
And we looked at new users,
resurrected users,

00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:37.534
people who weren't on
Facebook for 30 days and

00:20:37.534 --> 00:20:39.174
came back, and churned
users.

00:20:39.174 --> 00:20:41.169
And the resurrected and
churn numbers for

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:43.278
pretty much every product
I've ever seen,

00:20:43.278 --> 00:20:44.970
dominate the new user
account.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.100
Once you reach a sensible
point of growth,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.030
a couple of years, and
whatever.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.840
And all those users who were
churning and

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.030
resurrecting, had low friend
counts.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.410
And didn't find their
friends, and

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.470
so weren't connected to

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.040
the great stuff that was
going on, on Facebook.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.838
And so the number one thing
we needed to focus on

00:21:00.838 --> 00:21:02.960
was getting them to those
ten friends, getting them to

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.733
the whatever number of
friends they needed.

00:21:04.733 --> 00:21:06.448
So think about the user on
the margin,

00:21:06.448 --> 00:21:08.217
don't think about where
yourself when

00:21:08.217 --> 00:21:09.730
you're thinking about
growth.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.590
So, operating for

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.020
growth, what you really need
to think about is,

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.708
what is the north star of
your company.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.520
What is the one metric
where,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.810
if everyone in the company
is thinking about it and

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.530
driving their product was
that metric and

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.410
their actions towards moving
that metric up, you know in

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.660
the long run your company
will be successful.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.292
And by the way,

00:21:29.292 --> 00:21:31.333
they're probably all
correlated to each other so

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:32.894
it's fine to pick almost any
metric.

00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:35.643
Whichever one is like the
deepest, like, that you feel

00:21:35.643 --> 00:21:38.334
the best about, that aligns
with like your mission and

00:21:38.334 --> 00:21:40.750
your values, probably go for
that one.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.680
But realistically, daily
active users

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.360
fairly correlated to monthly
active users.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.700
We could've gone with either
one.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.020
Amount of content shared,
also very correlated to

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.230
how many users there are
because, guess what,

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.720
you add a user, they share
content.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.640
So, lots of things end up
being correlated.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.710
Pick the one that fits with
you and

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.550
that you know you're gonna
be able to stick with for

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.510
a long time, but have a
north star.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.140
Have a north star and know
the magic moment that when

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.490
a user experiences that,
they will deliver on that

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.890
metric for you on the north
star, and then think about

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.810
the marginal user, don't
think about yourself.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.400
Those are, I think, the
really important points when

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.370
you're operating for growth.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.900
Everything has to come from
the top.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.812
So the last area here is
tactics.

00:22:23.812 --> 00:22:26.548
And my hope was that I could
hit a few of these and then

00:22:26.548 --> 00:22:28.935
I've got a list of tactics I
wanna go through that

00:22:28.935 --> 00:22:31.673
I'm better talking with a
whiteboard and whatever on,

00:22:31.673 --> 00:22:34.178
but you can ask me questions
as I'm going through on

00:22:34.178 --> 00:22:36.530
those about how they work
and what goes better.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.890
But the important tactics
that you need to think about

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.090
this is great guy by the
way,

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.980
Tom Fishburne, he lives, he
lives in the Bay Area and

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.620
he does these really cynical
cartoons that I love.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.930
So let's say you found your,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.310
your niche market that
you're gonna have

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.580
a monopoly on inside the
mousetrap market.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.580
It's a silenced mousetrap
that's sitting under beds so

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.550
that if the mice come to
your bed overnight,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.690
like they can be killed
without waking you up, so

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.040
that's your niche market.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.760
And your, your mousetrap is
better than anybody else for

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.650
that market.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.260
What typically happens in
Silicon Valley is,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.430
everyone think mar, thinks
marketers are useless.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:09.880
Like I thought marketers
were useless when I

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.770
was a physics student, so
I'm

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.950
sure as engineering students
you must thing we're awful,

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.570
awful people who aren't
useful to have around.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.350
Like, build it and they will
come.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.350
That is something that is
very much the mantra in

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.890
the Valley and I don't
believe it's true.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.190
I believe you actually have
to work.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.700
There's a good article,
again, in the lecture page,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.920
from interviewing Ben
Silvermann where he

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.990
talks about how the growth
of

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.300
Pinterest was driven by
marketing.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.820
It's a really good article
to read into.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.760
I'm biased, of course.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.890
So, the first tactic I

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.680
want to talk about is
internationalization.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.720
Facebook internationalized
too late.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.510
Sheryl said it broadly in
public and

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.250
I definitely agree with
that.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.480
One of the biggest barriers
to our long term growth and

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.480
one of the biggest things we
have to deal with was

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.629
all the countries where
there were clones.

00:23:54.629 --> 00:23:59.094
Famously Studeveldt said had
Fakebook.css in their,

00:23:59.094 --> 00:24:01.050
in their HTML.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.560
And there were a ton of
sites like that out there,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.563
whether it was Studeveldt
site as a clear clone,

00:24:05.563 --> 00:24:09.790
Vkontakte, Mixi, Cyworld,
Orkut, there were all these

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.610
different social networks
around the world that

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.840
grew up while Facebook was
focused on the US.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.550
And so internationalizing
was an important barrier we

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.840
needed to knock down, and
knocking down barriers is

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.150
often a very important to
think about for growth.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.090
Facebook started off as
college only.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.010
So every college that it

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.579
was launched in was knocking
down a barrier.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.460
When Facebook expanded
beyond colleges to

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.480
high schools I wasn't at the
company, but that was a

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.110
company shaking moment where
people questioned whether or

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.740
not Facebook could actually
survive,

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.590
the culture of the site
could survive.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.910
Then expanding from high
schools to everyone,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.760
that was like, just before I
joined and

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.950
that was a shocking moment
and

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.800
that spurred the growth on
to 50 million and

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.690
then we hit a brick wall.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.406
And when we hit that brick
wall that was

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:52.422
the point when a lot of
existential questions were

00:24:52.422 --> 00:24:54.582
being asked inside Facebook
about whether any social

00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:57.240
network could ever get to
more than 100 million users.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.020
Which sounds stupid now, but

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.870
at the time no one had ever
achieved it.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.320
Everyone had kind of tapped
out between 50 and

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.520
100 million users and

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.010
we were worried that it
wasn't possible.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.680
And that was the point at

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.860
which the growth team got
set up.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.390
Chimoff brought a whole
bunch of us together.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.771
It was he said very publicly
that he wanted to fire me on

00:25:13.771 --> 00:25:17.085
multiple occasions, and he
probably should have done.

00:25:17.085 --> 00:25:18.065
But, without Chimoff I

00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:20.130
think none of us would have
stayed at the company.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.080
We were a really weird bunch
of people, but

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.400
it worked out.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.060
And, the two things we did,
I think, that really,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.980
really drove growth
initially, was number one,

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.060
we focused on that ten
friends in 14 days and

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.250
getting users to the magic
moment.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.170
And that was something Zuck
drove,

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.100
cuz we were all stuck in
analysis paralysis,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.060
saying is it causation, is
it correlation.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.390
Zuck was like, you really
think if no one

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.460
gets a friend that they'll
be active on Facebook?

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.110
Are you crazy?

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.850
The second thing was
internationalization.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.240
It was knocking down another
barrier.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.450
And when we launched it, I
think there were

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.380
two things that we did
really well.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.450
Number one was, even though
we were late, and

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.330
we were stressed about being
late,

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.660
we took the time to build it
in a scalable way.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.900
We moved slow to move fast.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.790
And you can actually read,

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.870
hear the full story from
Naomi in one of

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.060
the videos linked from the
lecture page.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.950
But what we did was we
wrapped all the strings in

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.840
the site in FPT which our
translation script, and

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.730
then, or translation
extraction script, and then,

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.220
we created the community
translation platform.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.390
So that we didn't just have

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.420
professional translators
translating a site we

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.330
could have all of our users
translating a site.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.350
And we got French translated
in 12 hours, but

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.280
we managed to get to this
day we are now at

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.182
104 languages translated by
Facebook for Facebook.

00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:40.470
80 plus 70 of those are
translated by the community.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.330
And we took the time to

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.980
build something that would
enable us to scale.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.920
The other thing is we

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.810
prioritized the right
languages.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.390
So back then the right
languages,

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.200
the big four languages were
French, Italian, German and

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.530
Spanish, figs and Chinese,
but

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.260
we were blocked in China.

00:26:59.054 --> 00:27:01.428
>> So we focused on French,
Italian, German,

00:27:01.428 --> 00:27:02.870
and Spanish.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.670
Now look at that list,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.520
that's today's distribution
of languages.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.090
Italian isn't on the list
anymore.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.050
French and German are about
to fall off.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.100
In the last year we
quadrupled the number of

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.700
people on Facebook in Hindi,
quadrupled.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:18.840
And so building for

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.910
where the world is today, is
an easy mistake to make and

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.450
it's what a lot of the other
social networks did.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.630
We built a scalable
translation infrastructure

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.880
that actually enabled us to
attack all of the languages,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.760
so we can be ready for

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.420
where the future is going
to, is gonna be.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.560
And you'll probably be able
to see some stuff

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.370
from our Internet.org Summit
in India about where we

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.595
want to go with language
translations later today,

00:27:39.595 --> 00:27:41.320
cuz I think they're talking
about that stuff there.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.860
So these are the tactics I
wanna go through now, and

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.970
I'll stick with the white
board for that stuff.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.040
But I'd really encourage you
guys as I go through these,

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.140
if you've got any questions
about them let me know.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.570
I think this should be like,

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.380
a more free form time
anyway.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:55.110
But I think some these

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.060
tactics are quite
interesting.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.340
So Virality.

00:28:00.815 --> 00:28:03.551
Yes, I think there are two
ways to look at virality.

00:28:03.551 --> 00:28:07.606
There's a great book whoops,
the book on the right here,

00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:09.749
by Adam Penenberg, Viral
Loop,

00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:13.193
goes through a bunch of case
studies of companies that

00:28:13.193 --> 00:28:16.160
have grown through viral
marketing.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.140
And I strongly encourage
you, if

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.160
you're interested in viral
marketing, to get that book.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.012
I think Ogilvy on
Advertising's great as well

00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:23.196
because chapter seven he's
like if you can't think of

00:28:23.196 --> 00:28:25.142
anything else stick a car to
a billboard with

00:28:25.142 --> 00:28:27.560
super glue and people will
buy your super glue.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.372
And he's got some really,

00:28:28.372 --> 00:28:30.030
he's got some really good
creative tips in there.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.023
>> Like the, the guy's been
dead 20 years and I think he

00:28:33.023 --> 00:28:35.951
still, I, I buy everyone on
my team gets both of these

00:28:35.951 --> 00:28:38.406
books when they start on my
team.

00:28:38.406 --> 00:28:39.470
So virality.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.450
So Sean Park has this model
that he taught or he

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.530
told us about when he, when,
when I joined Facebook.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.560
Which is to think about
virality for

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.610
a product in terms of three
things.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.650
First is payload.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.390
So how many people can you
hit with any

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:02.326
given viral blast?

00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.702
Second, he had cooler words
for

00:29:04.702 --> 00:29:07.841
these, I'm not quite as
cool.

00:29:07.841 --> 00:29:13.100
Second is conversion rate,
and third is frequency.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.230
Payload frequency and

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.480
conversion rate, whatever,
that order.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.640
So, how many people can you
hit at once is payload.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.890
How many times can you hit
them per blast is frequency.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.130
And what are they gonna
convert at?

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.180
And that gives you

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.870
a fundamental idea of how
viral a product is.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.074
So Hotmail is like, the
canonical example of

00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:36.730
brilliant viral marketing,
right?

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.840
Back when Hotmail launched,

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.000
there were a bunch of mail
companies that had

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.320
been funded and they were
throwing huge amounts of

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.170
money at traditional
advertising.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.570
How many people know the
Hotmail story, of virality?

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.570
Awesome, great, new
audience, sorry.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.859
Those two or three people
will be bored.

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:56.161
But Hotmail back in, back at
that time.

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.923
People couldn't get free
email clients,

00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:01.000
they had to be tied to their
ISP.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.650
And Hotmail and a few other
companies launched and

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.550
their clients were available
wherever you went.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:09.410
You could log in via library
internet or whatever,

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.690
school internet, and be able
to get access to that.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.140
Which was a really big value
proposition for

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.050
everyone, who wanted to
access it.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.770
Most of the companies, went
out there and

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.760
did big TV campaigns and
billboard campaigns and

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.740
newspaper campaigns and

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.050
things like that forced a
lot of advertising of Yahoo,

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.320
all of those things.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.040
But the Hotmail team didn't
have as much funding, and so

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.440
they had to scrabble around
to figure out how to do it.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.050
So, what they did was add
that little link at

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.390
the bottom of every email
that said,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.090
sent from Hotmail, get your
free email here.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.000
Now, the interesting thing
is that meant

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.640
the payload was low.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.580
Right, you email one person
at a time,

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.740
not necessarily gonna have a
huge payload.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.710
Maybe you send around some
of those viral spam emails.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.170
But then I'm not sure I'll
click on your link.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.090
The frequency is high,
though because you're

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.680
emailing the same people
over and over and over.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.060
Which means you're gonna hit
them once,

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.130
twice, three times a day
with that same link and

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.260
really move up the
impressions.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.290
And the conversion rate was
also very high because

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.370
people didn't like being
tied to their ISP email.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.020
And so Hotmail ended up
being

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.540
extremely viral because it
had high frequency and

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.420
high conversion rates.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.690
Another example is PayPal.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.880
PayPal, PayPal is
interesting because PayPal

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.490
has two sites to it.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.320
PayPal has the buyer and the
seller site.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.190
The other thing that's
interesting about PayPal is

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.050
its mechanism for viral
growth was eBay.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:29.670
And so you can use all kinds
of things for

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:33.090
virality that may not look
necessarily obviously viral.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.640
So PayPal, if you sent
money,

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.290
if you said to a seller, I
am going to send you money.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.800
Like, I can't think of a
higher conversion rate.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.360
Frequency was low, payload
was low, but

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.110
PayPal did this thing, where
they gave away money when

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.840
you got your friends to sign
up for PayPal, and

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.180
so that's how they went
viral on the consumer side.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.380
They didn't have to do that
for sellers,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.080
because if I said I'm gonna
send you money via this,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:57.750
you will take that.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.400
And even on the consumer
side they

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.990
went viral because someone
said sign up for

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.610
this thing and you'll get 10
bucks.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:04.640
Why wouldn't you?

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.260
So, they were able to go
viral, but

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.410
in both cases it was because
their conversion rate was

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.030
incredibly high on the buyer
and the seller side.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.720
No.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.030
Because their payload and
frequency was high.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:16.560
Makes sense?

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.440
So this is a really good way
to look at virality if

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.560
you wanna say, is this
product viral?

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.340
Facebook was not viral via
email sharing or

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.700
anything like that.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.180
Facebook was purely viral by
a word of mouth.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.580
Because the interesting
thing about PayPal and

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.770
Hotmail Is to use them the
first person had to

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.980
send an email to someone who
wasn't on the service.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.890
With Facebook there's no

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.250
native way to contact people
who aren't on the service.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.680
Everyone thinks of Facebook
as viral marketing success,

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.130
and that's actually, not how
it grew.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.130
It was word of mouth
virality, because it was an

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.110
awesome product you wanted
to tell your friends about.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:55.860
How's everyone doing?

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.770
Is this interesting?

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:57.505
Great, question, yes.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.440
>> So when you're talking
about this low pay

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.080
load in both of the
examples.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.330
In the later rounds as this
sort of campaign or

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.480
whatever you want to call it
gets going.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.542
Aren't you going to have a
much higher pay load as

00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:11.806
more and more people are
sending Hotmail] to more and

00:33:11.806 --> 00:33:13.818
more folks, and that way
your pay load grows and

00:33:13.818 --> 00:33:15.090
grows and grows?

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.610
So, the question is in the
first round it

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.170
makes sense that it has a
low pay load, but

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.640
in later rounds, aren't you
gonna have higher pay

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.410
loads as people send more
and more and more emails.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:23.760
I guess in my head, well,
first and

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.170
foremost, I think you
actually,

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.200
only send emails to a small
number of people.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.640
So, compared to like the
massive viral engines that

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.210
exist today,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.370
where you import someone's
entire contact book.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.690
And send them all.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.810
Send them all an email, or

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.490
where you post to everyone's
friends on Facebook.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.280
The actual payloads are
still very small.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.350
Even if it's everyone that

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.700
you email on a frequent
basis you hit.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.500
I'm also thinking really per
email sent out.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.290
How many people are on it?

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.640
But it's a fair point, like
yeah, as more people get on,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.260
get on Hotmail they'll send
more emails,

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.560
as more people use email.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.670
The product actually, grows
more and more successfully.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:55.770
So, that's a fair point.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.370
Go for it.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.480
>> Doesn't, like, point of
conversion also matter?

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.990
So, like, when just click
and sign up.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:03.399
But if you skip the goal ad
it's

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:06.490
>> Completely agree,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:08.060
that's why, oh I'm sorry.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.850
Doesn't point to conversion
matters as well, so

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.800
on Hotmail, you click to
sign up, but on a billboard

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.830
you have to remember that
the URL goes to the website,

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.470
type it in, find the
registration button,

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:17.620
click register and sign up.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.380
Yes.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.570
Yes, anything you can do to
move friction out of

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:21.690
the flow.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.420
And going from an offline ad
to an online ad removes huge

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.920
amounts of frictions from
the flow.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.630
Obviously.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.740
Totally agree with that.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.315
One more at the back.

00:34:28.315 --> 00:34:29.150
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion related?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.280
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.170
Absolutely.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.870
If you hit someone with the
same promotion,

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:36.940
I repeated that.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.940
Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.590
If you hit someone with the
same email over and over and

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:42.500
over again.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.300
All the same banner ads,
this is one of the things

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.520
that's fundamental about
online marketing.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.280
The same rules apply to
every channel.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.600
If you hit someone with the
same Facebook ad over, and

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.280
over, and over, the more
times you

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.700
hit them with the same ad
the less they'll click.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.250
That's why we have creative
exhaustion you have to

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.990
rotate creatives on
Facebook.

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.230
Same with banner ads, same
with news feed stories.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.360
The fiftieth time you see
the IQ story in

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.110
your news feed, you are not
gonna click on it.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.500
If you haven't clicked on
the 49 before,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.700
you're not gonna click on
the 50th.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.560
The same is absolutely true
with these emails.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.530
So, if you send the same
email over and

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.300
over and over to people for
an invite.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.700
Or if you send the same
little link at

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.730
the bottom over and over and
over to people for Hotmail.

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.630
Or I mean the PayPal one's

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.240
different because people
just signed up.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.370
But yes, you will get lower
conversion rate.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.160
And the more you hit someone
with

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.100
the same message the less
they convert.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.010
Is fundamental across every
online marketing channel,

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.290
every online marketing
channel, cool.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.670
Second way, to look at
virality,

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.120
which I think is awesome, is
by this guy Ed.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.950
And Ed runs the growth team
at Uber now,

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.230
he was at the growth team at
Facebook.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.870
And he was a Stanford MBA
student, and

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:49.410
did a class similar to this,

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.460
where they talked about
virility.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.420
And they all went and built
viral products.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.200
And there was a bunch of
press about that actually.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.950
And these brilliance of
these stuff.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:56.900
The interesting thing about
Uber.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.800
If you look at there growth
team

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.160
they're incredibly focused
on drivers.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.750
Because it's a two

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.530
sided market place they need
drivers.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.210
That's a huge, huge chunk of
their focus as a team.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.990
Even they've got like
probably the best viral guy

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.060
in the world at the company.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.260
So, with virality,

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.870
you get someone to contact
import, let's say.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.140
Then the question is,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.970
how many of those people do
you get to send imports?

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.630
Then the question is, to how
many people?

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.120
Then, how many click?

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.730
And you can put extra steps
in this.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.170
You could put how many open,
how many click, whatever.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.410
How many click, how many
sign up.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.390
And then how many of those
import.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.140
So essentially, you want
people who sign up to

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.270
your site, to import their
contacts.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.590
You want to then get them to
send an invite to all of

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:50.850
those contacts.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:52.350
You want to get.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.490
It to all of those contacts,
not just one of them.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.920
Then you want to get a
percentage of those to

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.960
click, and a percentage of
those to sign up.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.330
If you multiply out the
percents at every point in

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.150
this, this is essentially,

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.340
where well this isn't a
percent, this is a number.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.470
If you multiply those out,

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:08.680
that's essentially, the
point where you

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.010
get to the question of what
is the k factor.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.670
So, if you have, when
someone imports if on

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.708
average they send invites to
100 people.

00:37:19.708 --> 00:37:24.790
Sorry doing that wrong,
let's say 100

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.970
people get an invite per
person who imports.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.039
And then of those 10% click.

00:37:30.039 --> 00:37:31.930
That gets you to 10.

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:35.370
And then, of those, let's
say, 50% sign up.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.920
That gets you to 5.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.648
And then, of those,

00:37:38.648 --> 00:37:43.090
only 10 to 20% actually,
subsequently import.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:47.360
You're gonna be at a point
where you're at 0.5 to 1 as

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.700
your K factor.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.400
And you're gonna not be
viral.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.270
So, a lot of things like
Vidi are very good at

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:57.070
pumping, or were very good
at pumping out stories.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:00.210
They got the cave factor
over one, and it's perfectly

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.450
doable to get the cave
factor over one, but

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.320
if you have something that
doesn't have high retention

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.620
on the back end then it
doesn't really matter.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.840
So, you should look at your
invite flow and

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.999
say, what is my equivalent
import?

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.330
How many people, per import,
are invites sent to?

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.320
How many of those receive
clicks?

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.170
How many of those convert to
my site?

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.980
How many of those then
import?

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.380
To get an idea of your k
factor.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:23.970
But the really,

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.300
important thing is still to
think about retention, and

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.570
not to think about virality.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:31.670
And only do this after you
have a large

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.620
number of people retained on
your product per person

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.180
who signs up.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.308
So, couple more things we
were gonna touch on.

00:38:38.308 --> 00:38:44.210
SEO, email, SMS and push
notifications.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.710
So, in SEO,

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.390
there are three things you
need to think about.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.250
First one is keyword
research.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:50.740
People do this badly all the
time.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.980
So I launched this cocktail
site that I

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.860
talked to you about.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.730
I spent a year optimizing it
to rank for

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.040
the word cocktail making.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.650
Turns out in the UK no one
searches for

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.640
cocktail making.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.660
About 500 people a month.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.970
I dominated that search
term.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.490
It was awesome.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.480
>> I got 400 visitors a
month.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.780
It was amazing.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.480
Everyone searches for
cocktail recipes In the UK.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.110
And in the US, which is the
biggest market,

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.020
everyone searches for drink
recipes.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.890
So I optimize for the wrong
word.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:13.410
So you've gotta do

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.000
your research first about
what you're gonna go after.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.670
So, research consists of
what do people search for

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.100
that's related to your
sites, how many people

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.940
search for it, how many
other people are ranking for

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.856
it, and how valuable is it
for you.

00:39:27.856 --> 00:39:32.260
Supply, demands and value.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.260
Simple economics I guess.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.510
So you do your keyword
research.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:36.940
You figure out which
keywords you

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.260
want to rank for.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.410
There are great tools out
there to

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.450
enable you to do that.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.240
Honestly the best is quite
often the Google AdWords,

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.680
keyword planner tool.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.140
Really.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.380
Once you've done, that

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.260
the next most important
thing is links.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.550
So, page rank is how all of
SEO is essentially,

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.840
is driven and Google is
based on authority.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.550
Now there's a lot of other
things in Google's

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.880
algorithm now like do people
search for your website?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.720
There's a lot stuff about
the distribution of what

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.960
the anchor text is.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.130
That's send to your site.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.070
So, if you abuse it and

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:09.120
spam it they can pop up with
spam.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.390
White on a white background
five pages below the fold

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:12.300
doesn't work anymore.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.470
But, the single most
important thing is to

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.120
get valuable links from

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.980
high authority websites
future ranking Google.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.980
Most important thing.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.050
Then you need to distribute
that log inside your site,

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.550
by internally linking
effectively.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.670
And when I joined Facebook.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:31.596
We'd launched SEO in
September 2007,

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:33.890
which was before I joined.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.960
I joined November 2007.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.510
And we'd launched it, and we
were getting no traffic from

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.470
the pages we'd launched,
public user profiles.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.680
So, when I went in and
looked at it.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.100
The only way you could get
to any public user

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.290
profile was to click on the
footer of the page, for

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:49.909
the about link.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.660
Then click on one of the
blog articles,

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.050
then click on one of the
authors, and then spider out

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.506
through their friends to get
to all their friends.

00:40:57.506 --> 00:40:58.530
Turns out that,

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.290
Google was like they buried
these papers,

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:01.520
they're not very valuable,
and

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.080
we're not going to rank
them.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.850
We made one change.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.640
We added a directory so that
Google could quickly get to

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.190
every page on the site.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.440
And we 100 xd SEO traffic.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.010
Very, very simple change
drove a lot of

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.940
upside about distributing
the link love internally.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.200
And then the last thing is
there's a bunch of

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.120
table stakes stuff, HML
sitemaps,

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.850
making sure you have the
right headers, it's all

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.360
covered really well online
for what you wanna do.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.900
I'm gonna stop now and make
sure, cuz we have

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.260
a few questions, but, what
other questions are there?

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:31.650
Go for it.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.260
>> We're going to email
actually,.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:34.500
>> Let's go into email.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.130
Okay great.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.340
Email is dead for people
under 25 in my opinion.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.520
Right?
Young people don't

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.610
use email.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.600
They use WhatsApp, they use
SMS,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.690
they use Snapchat, they use
Facebook.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.750
They don't use email.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.270
If you're targeting an older
audience, email is,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.360
pretty successful.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.070
Email still works for
distribution, but

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.190
realistically, email is not
that great for

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.990
teenagers, especially, and
even people at university.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.950
You know, how much you use
instant messaging apps and

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.370
how little you use email.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.100
And you guys are probably,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.200
on the high end of the scale
for email,

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.119
because you're in Silicon
Valley.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.290
That being said, on email
the things to think about.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.750
Email, SMS, and

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.010
push notifications all
behave the same way.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.980
They all have questions of
deliverability.

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:19.080
So to finish first, first
you have to finish.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.640
Your email has to get to
someones inbox.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.330
So if you send a lot of spam
and

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.180
you end up with dirty IP's,
or you send spam from

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.820
shared servers where other
people are.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:30.270
Or if you send email
notifications, from shared

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.060
servers where other people
are sending spam from,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.030
you are gonna end up being
put in the spam folder

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.150
consistently, and your email
will fail completely.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.530
You may end up, being
blocked and

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.070
have your email bounce.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:41.580
There's a lot of

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.690
stuff around email where you
have to look.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.000
When you receive feedback
from the servers you

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.510
are sending email too.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.990
500 series errors versus 400
series errors,

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.180
you have to be respectful of
how those are handled.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.440
If someone gives you a hard
bounce, retry once or

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.590
twice and, then stop trying.

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:00.250
Because if you are someone
who abuses people's inboxes,

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:02.350
the email companies spam
folder you and

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.810
it's very hard to get out.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:05.690
If you get caught, on a
Spamhaus link, or

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:07.340
anything like that, it's
very hard to get out.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.190
It's really important with
email,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.470
that you are a high-class
citizen,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.300
that you do good work with
email because you want to

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.420
have deliverability for the
long run.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.910
That counts for push
notifications and SMS2.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.390
With SMS, you can go and buy
SMS traffic, via gray routes

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.250
with people with their
having phones strung up.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:30.730
Attached to a like computer
and pumping out SMS's.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.520
That works for a time but it
always get shut down.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.200
And I've seen so

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.100
many companies make these
mistakes.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.270
Where they think they're
gonna grow

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.960
by using these kind of
tactics.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.840
If you can't get your email,
your SMS or

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.120
your push delivered.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.830
You will never get any
success from these.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.950
Push, you spam your power
users, I know

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.250
that's slightly different to
what I said earlier.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.160
But you actually, spam your
power users and

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.100
give them notifications that
they don't care about and

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.600
make it really hard for them
to opt out.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.160
So, there's no settings
where they can opt out,

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.830
and they start blocking you.

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:58.960
You can never push them
once,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.520
they've opted out of your
push notifications.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.690
And it's very hard actually,
to prompt them to

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.860
turn them on once they've
turned them off.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.340
So, number one thing to
think about about email,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:09.020
SMS, and

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.100
push notification is you
have to get them delivered.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:14.660
Beyond that,

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.510
it's a question of open
rate, click through rate.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.470
So, what is the compelling
subject line you

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:20.360
can put there.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.430
So, that people are gonna
open your email.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:24.050
And how can you get them to
click when they visit?

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.880
Everyone focuses towards
doing,

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.850
marketing email that are
just spam.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.300
In my opinion Newsletters
are stupid.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:34.180
Don't do newsletters,
because you'll

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.250
send the same message to
everyone on your site.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:36.960
Someone, who signed up

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.760
to your site yesterday
versus someone,

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.860
who's been using your
product for three years.

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.980
Do they need the same
message?

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.070
No.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.930
The most effective email you
can do is notifications.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.840
So, what are you sending?

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.540
What should you be notifying
people of?

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.300
And this is a great place
where we're in

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.590
the wrong mindset.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.270
As a Facebook user I don't
want Facebook to email me

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.910
about every like I receive,
because I receive a lot of

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.430
likes cuz I've got a bunch
of Facebook friends.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.120
But as a new Facebook user,

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.190
that first like you receive
is a magic moment.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.010
Turning on that notification
across all of

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.500
of our channels, increased
the click through rate

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.500
on our email, SMS and
push-notifications.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.620
But we only turned it on,
for low-engaged users who

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.820
weren't coming back to the
site so

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.170
it wouldn't be spamming
them.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.120
So, it was a great
experience.

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.730
To think about that.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.890
What notifications should we
be sending

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.050
is the first thing you need
to think about on email,

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.170
SMS, and push.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.790
And then the second thing
you need to

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:33.900
be thinking about is.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.180
How can you create great

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.620
triggered marketing
campaigns?

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.570
So, when someone creates
their first,

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.280
cross border trade
transaction was one of

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.240
the best email campaigns, I
was ever part of at eBay in

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.170
terms of click-through
rates.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:46.180
It was awesome.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.590
Because it was really
timely,

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:50.260
really in context the right
thing to do for the user.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.440
So I'd say, make sure you
have deliverability.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.880
Most important thing.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.690
Focus on notifications and
trigger based email,

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.220
SMS, and push notifications
beyond that.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.760
So, I think we're out of
time.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.679
There's one thing I wanted
to finish with which is.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.180
And if you guys have any
questions, I guess, like,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:07.810
you can reach me and

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.120
if I get spammed, I just
won't reply.

00:46:10.484 --> 00:46:12.360
We have great spam filters,

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:18.740
no, my only favorite quotes
is from General Patton,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.940
and it's so cliche it's
crazy but it's awesome.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.260
A good plan, violently
executed today is

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.600
better than a perfect plan
tomorrow and

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.330
one of the things the most
instilled in us.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.030
And Harvey still instills in
us and Mark instills across

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.780
the whole of Facebook is
this move fast and

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.430
don't be afraid to break
stuff ethos.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.120
If you can run more
experiments than

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.500
the next guy, if you can be
hungry for growth.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.680
If you fight and die for
every extra user.

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.120
And you stay up late at
night to get those extra

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.570
users to run those
experiments to

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.270
get the data and do it over
and over and over again.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.880
You will grow faster.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.260
Marcus said he thinks we won
'cause we wanted it more,

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.990
and I really believe that.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.210
We just worked really hard.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.770
It's not like we're crazy
smart, or

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.300
we've all done these crazy
things before.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.830
We just worked really,
really hard,

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.110
and we executed fast.

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.700
And I strongly encourage you
to do that.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.538
Growth is optional.

00:47:06.538 --> 00:47:14.900
Thank you.

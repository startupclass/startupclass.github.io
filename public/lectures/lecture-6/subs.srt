1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,780
Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,194
>> Move us all, thank you.

3
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:04,489
Cool, so you guys this is
awesome,

4
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:07,326
I've been watching the
lectures in this course,

5
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:09,840
isn't it absolutely amazing
the content?

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,087
And now you're stuck with me
today.

7
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,429
>> We'll, so how that goes.

8
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,376
Unlike Paul, when he was
talking in the Q and A,

9
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,323
and you guys asked him what
he would do if he was at

10
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,055
college today and

11
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:22,030
he said physics, I actually
indulged myself.

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,730
I went in, I went and did
physics,

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,019
did physics at Cambridge and
I think physics is

14
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,661
an amazing class to give you
transferable skills that

15
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,380
are really useful in other
areas.

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,960
But I guess that's not,

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
that's not why you're
listening to me today.

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,660
Like, physics isn't the
class, like, so I paid for

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,590
college doing online
marketing.

20
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,030
Direct sales marketing.

21
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,650
I started with SEO in the
1990s.

22
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,830
I created a paper airplane
site.

23
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,250
I had a monopoly.

24
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,180
In the small niche market of

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,890
paper airplanes globally
which you know,

26
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,250
when you want to start a
startup also see how big

27
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,660
the market could be in the
long term it wasn't great.

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,810
But what that taught me was
how to do SEO.

29
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,860
And back in those days it
was Altavista, and

30
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,720
the way to do SEO was to
have white text on

31
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,650
a white background five
pages below the fold.

32
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,700
And you would rank top of
Alta Vista if you just paper

33
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,010
airplanes 20 or 30 times in
that text.

34
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,220
And that was how you won at
SEO in the 1990s.

35
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,350
Like it was a really easy,
easy skill to learn.

36
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,840
When I went to college,
being a physicist,

37
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,580
I thought paper airplanes
would make me cool, and

38
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,920
I was actually the most
nerdy person in

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,230
the physics class, so I
created a cocktail site.

40
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,050
Which was how I learned to
program.

41
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,840
And that grew to be the
largest cocktail site in

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,210
the UK.

43
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,990
And that really got me into
SEO properly when

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,130
Google launched.

45
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,070
So with Google, you had to
worry about page rank, and

46
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,220
you had to worry about
getting links

47
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,810
back to your site.

48
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,010
Which basically, at that
stage,

49
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,260
meant one link from the
Yahoo directory.

50
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,750
Got you to the top listing
in Google if you had white

51
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,630
text, on a white background,
below the fold, as well.

52
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,520
When Google launched AdWords
that's when I

53
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,260
really started to learn how
to do all my marketing.

54
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,220
And that was buying paid
clicks from Google, and

55
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,480
reselling them to eBay for

56
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,970
a small margin of like 20%
using our affiliate program.

57
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,530
And that was what really
kicked me into overdrive

58
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,890
into doing what everyone
nowadays talks about is

59
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,370
growth, or growth hacking,
or growth marketing.

60
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,100
And in my mind it's just
internet marketing.

61
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,080
Using whatever channel you

62
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
can to get whatever output
you want.

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,820
And that's how I paid for
college and how I

64
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,430
ended up going from being a
physicist to a marketer and

65
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,110
transitioning to the dark
side of the force.

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,480
So what do you think matters
most for growth.

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,870
You've had loads of lectures
and

68
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,260
people have said it over and
over, so

69
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,970
what do you guys think
matters most for growth?

70
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,380
Someone give me an answer.

71
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,090
>> Great product.

72
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,750
>> Great product.

73
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,820
I agree, great product.

74
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,350
What does great product lead
to?

75
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,060
>> Customers.

76
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,640
>> Customers.

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,466
And what do you need those
customers to do?

78
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,058
>> Spread the word.

79
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:43,250
Someone said stay on your
site.

80
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,010
Someone said that.

81
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,530
That's it.
Retention.

82
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,450
Retention is the single most
important thing for growth.

83
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,390
Now we have an awesome
growth team at Facebook, and

84
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm super proud to work on
it.

85
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,400
But the truth of

86
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,230
the matter is we have a
fantastic product.

87
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,000
But getting to work on
growth at Facebook is

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,570
a massive privilege, because
we're promoting something

89
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,430
that everyone in the world
really wants to use.

90
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,690
Which is absolutely
incredible.

91
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,110
If we can get people on, and

92
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,740
get them ramped up, they
stick on Facebook.

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,810
So many times I go advise
multiple startups,

94
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,460
my favorite was working with
Airbnb, but

95
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,980
I've worked with Coursera,
I've worked with

96
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,550
other ones that haven't done
as well as those guys.

97
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,990
But the one thing that is
true over, and over, and

98
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,850
over again is if you look at
this curve.

99
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,050
The sentiment, the active,

100
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,890
versus number of days from
acquisition.

101
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,140
If you end up with a
retention curve that

102
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,080
ascentotes to a line
parallel to the x axis.

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
You have a viable business,
and

104
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,080
you have product market fit
for some subset of market.

105
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,790
But most of the companies
that you see fly up,

106
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,780
we talk about growth hacking
and virality and

107
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,860
all of this other stuff.

108
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm gonna try so hard not to
swear, but it'll happen.

109
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,480
Their attention curve slopes
down towards the X-axis, and

110
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,620
in the end intercepts the
X-axis.

111
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,040
Now when I show this chart
to

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,720
most people they say that's
all well and good.

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,290
You had a million people a
day in terms of

114
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,500
growth when you started the
growth team at Facebook, or

115
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,320
you were at 50 million
users.

116
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,950
You had a lot of people
joining the site so

117
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,280
you had a ton of data to do
this.

118
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
We used this same
methodology for

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
our B to B growth.

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Getting people to sign up as
self-service advertisers,

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,300
we used this analysis to
understand how much

122
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,070
growth we were gonna have in
that market as well.

123
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,140
And in that place,

124
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,180
when I joined Facebook, the
product was three days old.

125
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,020
And within 90 days of the
product launching,

126
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,990
we were able to use this
technique to be able to

127
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,600
figure out what the one year
value of an advertiser was,

128
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
and we predicted it for the
first year to 97% of

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,460
what the number turned out
to be.

130
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,880
So I think it's very
important to look at

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,730
your attention curve, and
this is how we did it.

132
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,520
If you see here.

133
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,420
This red line is number of
users,

134
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,560
who have been on your
product for

135
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
a certain number of days.

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,090
So, a bunch of people, that
should say zero,

137
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,180
a bunch of people will have
been on your product,

138
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,900
all of your users will have
been on it at least one day.

139
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
But, if your product's been
around a year, or whatever,

140
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,940
you will have zero users
who've been on it 366 days.

141
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,530
Make sense?

142
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,480
The curves sensible?

143
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,870
Cool.

144
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,400
So what you then do is look
for all of your users,

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,450
who have been on your
product one day.

146
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,440
What percentage of them are
monthly active.

147
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,610
100% for the first 30 days
obviously,

148
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,360
because monthly active they
all signed up on one day.

149
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,150
But then you look at 31.

150
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,920
Every single user, on their
31st day after registration,

151
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,910
what percentage of them were
monthly active, 32nd day,

152
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,910
33rd day, 34th day?

153
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,030
And that allows you,

154
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,120
with only something like
10,000 customers or

155
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,050
whatever, to get a real idea
of what this curve is

156
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,630
gonna look like for your
product.

157
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,738
And you're gonna be able to
tell does it asymptote.

158
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,670
And it'll get noisy out
towards the right-hand side.

159
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,270
Like I'm not using real
data.

160
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,980
It'll get noisy out towards
the right hand side, but

161
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,820
you'll be able to get a
handle on,

162
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,280
does this curve flatten out
or does it not.

163
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,100
If it doesn't flatten out,
don't go and

164
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
do growth tactics, don't go
and

165
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,950
do virality, don't hire a
growth hacker.

166
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,840
Focus on getting product
market fit.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,600
Because in the end,

168
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,780
as Sam said in the beginning
of this course,

169
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,610
idea, product, team,
execution.

170
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,980
If you don't have a great
product,

171
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,070
there's no point executing
well on growing it.

172
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,760
Because it won't grow.

173
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
Number one problem I've seen
inside Facebook for

174
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,550
new products, number one
problem I've seen for

175
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,590
startups I ever devised has
been, they don't actually

176
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,360
have product market fit when
they think they do.

177
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,000
So the next obvious question
that people ask over and

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,450
over and over again is okay,
so

179
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,010
what does good retention
look like?

180
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,200
Sure I can have five percent
retention but

181
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm guessing that Facebook
had better than that, so

182
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,090
that's not gonna be a
successful business.

183
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,240
And I get really pissed off
when

184
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,220
people ask me that question.

185
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,610
Because I think you can
figure it out.

186
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,620
And I love this story, and
this is like my one

187
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,860
gratuitous story that I love
that I'm throwing in here,

188
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,950
so the rest of it may not be
as gratuitous.

189
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,870
But this is a picture that
was published in

190
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,120
Life magazine in 1950 of

191
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,210
one of the Trinity nuclear
bomb tests.

192
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,210
And there's a guy,

193
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,740
Geoffrey Taylor, who's heard
of Geoffrey Taylor.

194
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,850
Awesome.

195
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,370
Yes.

196
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,450
Someone's heard of him.

197
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,200
Geoffrey Taylor was a
British physicist,

198
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,490
who ended up actually
winning the Nobel Prize.

199
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,490
And he was able to figure
out from looking at

200
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,440
this picture, what the power
of the atomic bomb was,

201
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,610
the U.S. atomic bomb.

202
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,800
And Russian's were
publishing similar pictures,

203
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,720
just using dimensional
reasoning.

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,820
And dimensional reasoning is
I think,

205
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,690
one of the best skills that
I learned during my

206
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,260
time studying physics back
in the U.K..

207
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,780
And what dimensional
reasoning is, is you look at

208
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,690
the dimensions that are
involved in a problem.

209
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,210
So, you wanna figure out
energy?

210
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,310
Newtons, meters, newtons are
kilograms, meters are second

211
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,060
to the minus 2, so you've
got kilograms,

212
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,570
meters squared, seconds to
the minus 2,

213
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,850
and then you try and figure
out how you can get each of

214
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,430
those numbers from what data
you have.

215
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,280
So, the mass.

216
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,620
Is the volume of this
sphere.

217
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,950
So, that's a meter cubed you
throw in there.

218
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,590
So you've got meters the 5
over seconds the minus 2,

219
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,300
and he was able to use that
to just figure out

220
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,200
what the power of this
atomic bomb was,

221
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,030
what the ratios of the power
between the Russian and

222
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,230
US atomic bomb, and
essentially reveal one of

223
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,400
the top secrets that existed
in the world at that time.

224
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,160
That's a hard problem.

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,790
Figuring out what

226
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,130
Facebook's retention rate is
not a hard problem.

227
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,140
How many people are there on
the internet?

228
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,823
Give or take someone throw
something out.

229
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,380
>> 2.4 billion, 2.3 billion.

230
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,630
Something like that right?

231
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,320
Okay, Facebook's banned in
China.

232
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,310
So.

233
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:25,810
What now?

234
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,230
>> About a billion.

235
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,250
>> About 2 billion?

236
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,440
2 billion.
So

237
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,760
2 billion people on the
internet.

238
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,030
Facebook in their last
earnings call

239
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,620
said something around 1.3
billion in

240
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,830
terms of the number of
active users.

241
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,550
You can divide those numbers
by each other.

242
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,330
And yeah, that won't give
you the right answer.

243
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,780
Course it's not gonna give
you the right answer.

244
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,450
But it's gonna give you

245
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,250
close enough to a ballpark
figure.

246
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,540
Of what the retention rate
looks like for Facebook.

247
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,510
If we signed everyone on the
internet up, and

248
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,650
then you will know it is
higher than that.

249
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,610
Similarly if you look at
Whats App, they've announced

250
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,550
six hundred million active
users.

251
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,700
How many people have smart
phones?

252
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,800
You can figure out that
number.

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,490
That number is out knocking
around.

254
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,180
It can give an idea of how
many users there are.

255
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,230
Amazon has had a pop at

256
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,720
signing up almost everyone
in the United States.

257
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,930
You know how many people are
online in the US, and

258
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,940
you've got a good idea of
how many

259
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,030
customers Amazon are from
the numbers they throw out.

260
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,300
Different verticals need
different terminal retention

261
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,580
rates for them to have
successful businesses.

262
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,610
If you're in e-commerce and
you're retaining on

263
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,160
a monthly active basis like
20, 30% of your users,

264
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,340
you're probably gonna do
pretty well.

265
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,560
If you're in social media,
and

266
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,260
your first batch of people
signing up to

267
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,850
your product are not like
80% retained,

268
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,630
you're not gonna have a
massive social media site.

269
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,920
And so, it really depends on
the vertical you're in,

270
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,540
what the retention rates
are.

271
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,450
What you need to do is have
the tools to

272
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,690
think about who out there is
comparable.

273
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,377
And how you can look at it
and say,

274
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:50,030
am I anywhere close to what
real success looks like in

275
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,888
this vertical?

276
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:54,429
So retention is

277
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,370
the single most important
thing for growth.

278
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,150
And retention comes from
having a great idea, and

279
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,030
a great product to back up
that idea and

280
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,960
great product market fit.

281
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,530
The way we look at whether a
product has great retention

282
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,490
or not is whether or not the
users who install it.

283
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,420
Actually stay on it long
term,

284
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,640
when you normalize on a
cohort basis, and

285
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
I think that's a really good
methodology for

286
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,100
looking at your product and
saying, okay, the first 100,

287
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,690
the first 1,000, the first
10,000 people I get on this,

288
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,400
will they be retained in the
long run?

289
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,240
So now how do you attack
operating for growth?

290
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,730
Let's say you have awesome
product market fit.

291
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,240
You have built an e-commerce
site and you have 60% of

292
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,230
people coming back every
single month and

293
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,260
making a purchase from you.

294
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,790
Which would be absolutely
fantastic.

295
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,650
How do you take that and say
now it's time to scale?

296
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,640
Now it's time to

297
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,240
execute was the last thing
in your thought.

298
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,920
Right?

299
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,330
And that's where I think
growth teams come in.

300
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,280
Like my contrarian
viewpoint, or

301
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,740
whatever is if you're a
start-up you

302
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,890
shouldn't have a growth
team.

303
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,304
>> Damn it.

304
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,900
So close.

305
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,670
Halfway through and I
failed.

306
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,045
You shouldn't have a growth
team.

307
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,220
Start-ups should not have
growth teams.

308
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,020
The whole company should be
the growth team.

309
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,280
The CEO.

310
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,610
Should be the head of
growth.

311
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,620
You need someone to set a
North Star for

312
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,910
you, gratuitous shot of the,
you know, NASA page.

313
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,930
You need someone to set a
North Star for

314
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,920
you about where the company
wants to go.

315
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,240
And that person needs to be
the person leading

316
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,630
the company, in my opinion,
from what I've seen.

317
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,420
And Mark is a fantastic
example of that.

318
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,490
Back when Facebook started
lots of people were

319
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,840
putting out their registered
user numbers.

320
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,020
Right?
You'd see registered user

321
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,770
numbers for MySpace.

322
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,120
You'd see registered user
numbers for Compact.

323
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
You'd see registered user
numbers.

324
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,430
Mark put out monthly active
users as the number both

325
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,410
internally he held everyone
to.

326
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,180
And said we need everyone on
Facebook, but

327
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,060
that means everyone active
on Facebook.

328
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,770
Not everyone signed up to
Facebook.

329
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,640
So monthly active people was
the number internally.

330
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,650
And it was also the number
he published externally.

331
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,120
It was the number he made
the whole world hold

332
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,860
Facebook to as the number
that we cared about.

333
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,960
If you look at what Yam has
done with What's Up I

334
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,710
think it's another great
example.

335
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,140
He always published send
numbers.

336
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,490
If you're a messaging
application,

337
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,120
sends is probably the single
most important number.

338
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,030
If people use you once a
day.

339
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,420
Maybe that's great, but they
send one message.

340
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,510
They, you're not really
their primary messaging

341
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,190
mechanism, so Yan published
the sentence number.

342
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,770
Right?

343
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,180
Inside AvianB they talk
about nice book, and

344
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,540
they also published that in
all of the,

345
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,740
like, infographics that you
see inside Tech Crunch.

346
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,250
They always benchmark
themselves against how many

347
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:34,970
nights booked they

348
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,440
have compared to the largest
hotel chains in the world.

349
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,420
They have, each of these
companies,

350
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,080
a different north star.

351
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,350
The north start doesn't have
to be

352
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,850
monthly active users for
every different vertical.

353
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,920
For eBay, when I was there,

354
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,230
it was gross merchandised
volume.

355
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,320
How much stuff did people
actually buy through eBay.

356
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,640
Everyone externally tends to
judge eBay based on revenue.

357
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Actually, Benedict Evans has

358
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,870
done this amazing breakdown
of Amazon's business.

359
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,890
Which is really interesting.

360
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,700
To look at their marketplace
business versus their

361
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,790
direct business.

362
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,020
EBay is all marketplace
business, right.

363
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,760
So eBay's being judged by
its revenue when it

364
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,010
actually has ten times, or
whatever more

365
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,610
gross merchandised volume
going through the site.

366
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,590
And that was the number that
eBay looked at when I

367
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,540
was inside there, and
optimized for.

368
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,970
So every different company
when it

369
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,970
thinks about growth needs a
different north star.

370
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,550
But when you are operating
for

371
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,310
growth, it is critical that
you have that north star and

372
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,370
you define it as a leader.

373
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,440
The reason this matters is.

374
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,020
The second you have more
than one person working on

375
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,600
anything, you cannot control
what everyone else is doing.

376
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,270
Right?

377
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,940
I promise you,

378
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,450
having now might have hit
100 people I'm managing,

379
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,960
I have no control.

380
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
It's all influence.

381
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,820
Yes, I can say to one
person, do this one thing.

382
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,420
But then the other 99

383
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,090
are gonna do whatever the
hell they want.

384
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,090
And the thing is, it's not
clear to everybody what

385
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,470
the most important thing is
a for a company.

386
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,010
It would be very easy inside
eBay for

387
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,070
people to say, you know
what?

388
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,250
We should focus on revenue.

389
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,921
Or you know what?
We should focus on

390
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:04,928
the number of people buying
from us.

391
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,901
Or you know what?
We should focus on

392
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:06,873
how many people list items
on eBay.

393
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,880
And Pierre and Meg and John.

394
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,460
Those guys, those various
leaders, always said no,

395
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,160
it's the amount of gross
merchandise volume that

396
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,960
goes through our site.

397
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,895
It's the percentage of

398
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,740
e-commerce that goes through
our site.

399
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,402
That is what really matters
for this company.

400
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,420
Which means when people are
having a conversation and

401
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,220
you're not in the room, when
they're sitting in front of

402
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,410
their computer screen and
thinking about how they

403
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,690
build this particular
product or

404
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,140
this particular feature.

405
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:29,980
In their head,

406
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,290
it's gonna be clear to them
that it's not about revenue.

407
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,270
It's about gross merchandise
volume.

408
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,250
Or it's not about getting
more registrations.

409
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,300
Registrations don't matter
unless they become long term

410
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,940
active users.

411
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,480
A great example of this is
when I was at Ebay in 2004.

412
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,933
We changed the way we paid
our affiliates for

413
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:50,874
new users.

414
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:53,822
And affiliate programs are a
bit out of fashion these

415
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:54,425
days, but

416
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:57,307
the idea of an affiliate
program is essentially you

417
00:14:57,307 --> 00:14:58,925
pay anyone on the internet.

418
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,246
A referral for sending
traffic to your site.

419
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,384
But it's mostly about
getting access to like,

420
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,041
big marketers who do it on
their own,

421
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:06,950
like separately and

422
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,550
some really good stories
from this.

423
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,480
We were paying for confirmed
registered users.

424
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,282
So all of our affiliates
were aligned,

425
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,360
they're out getting
confirmed registered users,

426
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,370
to the base site.

427
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,910
We changed our payment model
to pay for

428
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,470
activated confirmed
registered users.

429
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,440
So you had to confirm your
account and

430
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,150
then bid on an item, or buy
an item or

431
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,170
list an item, to become
someone that we paid for.

432
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,080
Overnight when we made that
change,

433
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,160
we lost something like 20%
of confirmed registered

434
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,090
users that were being driven
by the affiliates.

435
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,816
But the ACIUs only dropped
by about 5%.

436
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,427
The ratio of CIU to ACIU
went up, and

437
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:54,270
then the growth of ACIUs,
massively accelerated.

438
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,200
The cause of this was if you
wanna drive CRUs if

439
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,030
someone searches for

440
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,680
a trampoline, you land them
on the registration page cuz

441
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,100
they think they have to
register and

442
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,150
confirm, before they get
that trampoline.

443
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,855
If you wanna drive ACRUs you
land them on the search

444
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,210
results page within eBay for
trampolines so they can see

445
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,970
the thing they want to buy,
get excited about it and

446
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,170
register when they want to
buy it.

447
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,480
And if you drive just CRUs
people don't

448
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,350
have an amazing,

449
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,930
magic moment on eBay when
they visit the site.

450
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,600
And that's the next most
important thing to

451
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,220
think about, is how do you
drive towards the magic

452
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,590
moment that gets people
hooked on your service?

453
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,010
So in the lecture notes for

454
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,350
this course I've stuck in a
bunch of links to people I

455
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,470
think are brilliant at all
of this stuff.

456
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,450
That retention curve I
showed earlier,

457
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,650
there's a link to this guy
Danny Ferrante

458
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,650
whose incredible talking
about retention curves.

459
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,716
The magic moment, there are
two videos linked.

460
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,400
One is Chimoff talking about
growth,

461
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,820
who was the guy who set up
the growth team at Facebook.

462
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,614
And one is my friend Naomi
and

463
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,857
I talking at F8 four years
ago about how we

464
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:57,986
were thinking about growth
back then.

465
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,267
And in both of those mem,

466
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:02,480
both of those videos we talk
about the magic moment.

467
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,390
So, what do you guys think
the magic moment is for

468
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,560
when you're signing up to
Facebook?

469
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,080
You hit that big green
button,

470
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,124
what is the moment when
users are like ha?

471
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,730
Mark even talked about it at
the start up

472
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,820
school a few years back.

473
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,680
>> See your friends.

474
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,610
>> See your friends.

475
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,060
Simple as that.

476
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,400
And usually it is very
simple.

477
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,670
I talked to so many
companies, and they try and

478
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,180
get incredibly complicated
about what they're doing.

479
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,560
But it is as simple as just
when you see that

480
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,460
first picture of one of your
friends on Facebook.

481
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,300
You go, oh my God, this is
what the site is about.

482
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,573
And Zucks talked at Y
Combinator about

483
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,340
getting people to ten
friends in 14 days.

484
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,760
That is why we focus on that
metric.

485
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,520
The number one most
important thing in

486
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,270
a social media site is
connecting to your friends.

487
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,085
Because without that,

488
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,650
you have a completely empty
news feed, and

489
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,100
clearly you're not gonna
come back.

490
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,420
You'll never get any
notifications,

491
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,770
you'll never have any
friends telling you

492
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,660
about things they're missing
on the site.

493
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,640
So for Facebook the magic
moment is that moment when

494
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,100
you see your friend's face,
and

495
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,580
everything we do on growth.

496
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,330
And if you look at the
LinkedIn registration flow,

497
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,850
or you look at the Twitter
registration flow,

498
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,320
or you look at what WhatsApp
does when you sign up,

499
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
the number one thing all
these services look to

500
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,550
do is to show you the people
you want to follow,

501
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,540
connect to, send messages
to, as quickly as possible.

502
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,339
Because in this vertical,
that's what matters.

503
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,990
When you think about Airbnb
or you think about eBay,

504
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,750
it's finding on eBay that
unique item,

505
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,000
that PEZ dispenser or broken
laser pointer that you

506
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,930
really, really cared about,
and wanted to get hold of.

507
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,530
Like when you see that
collectible thing that you

508
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,000
were missing, that is the
real magic moment on eBay.

509
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,370
When you look on Airbnb and

510
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:34,150
you find that first, you
find that,

511
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,750
that first listing that's
like a cool house that you

512
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,360
can stay in and

513
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,660
when you go through the
door, that's a magic moment.

514
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,800
And similarly on the other
side,

515
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
when you're listing your
house,

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,660
the first time you get paid,
is an amazing moment.

517
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,880
When you're listing an item
on eBay,

518
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,860
the first time you get paid
is a magic moment.

519
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,410
You should ask Brian what he
thinks,

520
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,613
cuz they've done these
amazing storyboards which I

521
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,765
think has been shared, of
like the journey through

522
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,338
a user's moment on life on,
on Airbnb and how excited.

523
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:58,300
Isn't, he's talking in three
lectures time?

524
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,980
The guy's awesome at talking
about the magic moment and

525
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,410
getting his users to feel
love and

526
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,980
joy and all this stuff.

527
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,600
So think about what the
magic moment is for

528
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,870
your product, and

529
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,830
get people connected to it
as fast as possible.

530
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,440
Because then you

531
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,000
can move up where that blue
line has asymptoted.

532
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,832
Then you can go from 50%
retention to 60% retention

533
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,782
to 70% retention easily, if
you can connect people with

534
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,030
the thing that makes them
stick on your site.

535
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,600
The second thing to think
about is everyone in

536
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,380
the Valley gets wrong, that
we optimize when we

537
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,050
think about growth for
ourselves.

538
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,060
So my favorite example is
notifications.

539
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Again, talk to lots of
companies, advise lots of

540
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,900
companies, every single
company when they

541
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,190
talk about notifications,
goes, oh I'm getting too

542
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,890
many notifications, I think
that's what we

543
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,830
need to optimize for in
notifications.

544
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,998
Okay, are your power users
leaving your site

545
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:51,093
because they're getting too
many notifications?

546
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,122
No, then why would you
optimize that,

547
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:55,960
they're probably grownups
and they can use filters.

548
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,850
What you need to focus on is
the marginal user.

549
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,760
The one person who doesn't
get a notification in

550
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,360
a given day, or month, or
year.

551
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,070
Our experience of our
products, and

552
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,740
by the way like building an
awesome product is

553
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,120
all about thinking about the
power user, right?

554
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,360
Building an incredible
product

555
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,800
is definitely optimizing for

556
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,870
the people who use your
product the most.

557
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,350
But driving growth,

558
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,210
people who are already using
your product all the time,

559
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,500
are not the ones you have to
worry about.

560
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,783
So, in this Danny Ferrante
video there's also this link

561
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:28,733
from the lecture page,

562
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,063
there's also talk about our
growth accounting framework

563
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,601
that we use to think about
for growth.

564
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,067
And we looked at new users,
resurrected users,

565
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,534
people who weren't on
Facebook for 30 days and

566
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:39,174
came back, and churned
users.

567
00:20:39,174 --> 00:20:41,169
And the resurrected and
churn numbers for

568
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,278
pretty much every product
I've ever seen,

569
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:44,970
dominate the new user
account.

570
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,100
Once you reach a sensible
point of growth,

571
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,030
a couple of years, and
whatever.

572
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,840
And all those users who were
churning and

573
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,030
resurrecting, had low friend
counts.

574
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,410
And didn't find their
friends, and

575
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,470
so weren't connected to

576
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,040
the great stuff that was
going on, on Facebook.

577
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,838
And so the number one thing
we needed to focus on

578
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,960
was getting them to those
ten friends, getting them to

579
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,733
the whatever number of
friends they needed.

580
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,448
So think about the user on
the margin,

581
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,217
don't think about where
yourself when

582
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,730
you're thinking about
growth.

583
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,590
So, operating for

584
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,020
growth, what you really need
to think about is,

585
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,708
what is the north star of
your company.

586
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,520
What is the one metric
where,

587
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,810
if everyone in the company
is thinking about it and

588
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,530
driving their product was
that metric and

589
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,410
their actions towards moving
that metric up, you know in

590
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,660
the long run your company
will be successful.

591
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,292
And by the way,

592
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,333
they're probably all
correlated to each other so

593
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,894
it's fine to pick almost any
metric.

594
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:35,643
Whichever one is like the
deepest, like, that you feel

595
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,334
the best about, that aligns
with like your mission and

596
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,750
your values, probably go for
that one.

597
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,680
But realistically, daily
active users

598
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,360
fairly correlated to monthly
active users.

599
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,700
We could've gone with either
one.

600
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,020
Amount of content shared,
also very correlated to

601
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,230
how many users there are
because, guess what,

602
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,720
you add a user, they share
content.

603
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,640
So, lots of things end up
being correlated.

604
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,710
Pick the one that fits with
you and

605
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,550
that you know you're gonna
be able to stick with for

606
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,510
a long time, but have a
north star.

607
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,140
Have a north star and know
the magic moment that when

608
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,490
a user experiences that,
they will deliver on that

609
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,890
metric for you on the north
star, and then think about

610
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,810
the marginal user, don't
think about yourself.

611
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,400
Those are, I think, the
really important points when

612
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,370
you're operating for growth.

613
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,900
Everything has to come from
the top.

614
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,812
So the last area here is
tactics.

615
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:26,548
And my hope was that I could
hit a few of these and then

616
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,935
I've got a list of tactics I
wanna go through that

617
00:22:28,935 --> 00:22:31,673
I'm better talking with a
whiteboard and whatever on,

618
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:34,178
but you can ask me questions
as I'm going through on

619
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,530
those about how they work
and what goes better.

620
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,890
But the important tactics
that you need to think about

621
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,090
this is great guy by the
way,

622
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,980
Tom Fishburne, he lives, he
lives in the Bay Area and

623
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,620
he does these really cynical
cartoons that I love.

624
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,930
So let's say you found your,

625
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,310
your niche market that
you're gonna have

626
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,580
a monopoly on inside the
mousetrap market.

627
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,580
It's a silenced mousetrap
that's sitting under beds so

628
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,550
that if the mice come to
your bed overnight,

629
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,690
like they can be killed
without waking you up, so

630
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,040
that's your niche market.

631
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,760
And your, your mousetrap is
better than anybody else for

632
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,650
that market.

633
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,260
What typically happens in
Silicon Valley is,

634
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,430
everyone think mar, thinks
marketers are useless.

635
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,880
Like I thought marketers
were useless when I

636
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,770
was a physics student, so
I'm

637
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,950
sure as engineering students
you must thing we're awful,

638
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,570
awful people who aren't
useful to have around.

639
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,350
Like, build it and they will
come.

640
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,350
That is something that is
very much the mantra in

641
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,890
the Valley and I don't
believe it's true.

642
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,190
I believe you actually have
to work.

643
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,700
There's a good article,
again, in the lecture page,

644
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,920
from interviewing Ben
Silvermann where he

645
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,990
talks about how the growth
of

646
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,300
Pinterest was driven by
marketing.

647
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,820
It's a really good article
to read into.

648
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm biased, of course.

649
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,890
So, the first tactic I

650
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,680
want to talk about is
internationalization.

651
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,720
Facebook internationalized
too late.

652
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,510
Sheryl said it broadly in
public and

653
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,250
I definitely agree with
that.

654
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,480
One of the biggest barriers
to our long term growth and

655
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
one of the biggest things we
have to deal with was

656
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,629
all the countries where
there were clones.

657
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:59,094
Famously Studeveldt said had
Fakebook.css in their,

658
00:23:59,094 --> 00:24:01,050
in their HTML.

659
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,560
And there were a ton of
sites like that out there,

660
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,563
whether it was Studeveldt
site as a clear clone,

661
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:09,790
Vkontakte, Mixi, Cyworld,
Orkut, there were all these

662
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,610
different social networks
around the world that

663
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,840
grew up while Facebook was
focused on the US.

664
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,550
And so internationalizing
was an important barrier we

665
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,840
needed to knock down, and
knocking down barriers is

666
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,150
often a very important to
think about for growth.

667
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,090
Facebook started off as
college only.

668
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,010
So every college that it

669
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,579
was launched in was knocking
down a barrier.

670
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,460
When Facebook expanded
beyond colleges to

671
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,480
high schools I wasn't at the
company, but that was a

672
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,110
company shaking moment where
people questioned whether or

673
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,740
not Facebook could actually
survive,

674
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,590
the culture of the site
could survive.

675
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,910
Then expanding from high
schools to everyone,

676
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,760
that was like, just before I
joined and

677
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,950
that was a shocking moment
and

678
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,800
that spurred the growth on
to 50 million and

679
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,690
then we hit a brick wall.

680
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,406
And when we hit that brick
wall that was

681
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,422
the point when a lot of
existential questions were

682
00:24:52,422 --> 00:24:54,582
being asked inside Facebook
about whether any social

683
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,240
network could ever get to
more than 100 million users.

684
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,020
Which sounds stupid now, but

685
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,870
at the time no one had ever
achieved it.

686
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,320
Everyone had kind of tapped
out between 50 and

687
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,520
100 million users and

688
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,010
we were worried that it
wasn't possible.

689
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,680
And that was the point at

690
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,860
which the growth team got
set up.

691
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,390
Chimoff brought a whole
bunch of us together.

692
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,771
It was he said very publicly
that he wanted to fire me on

693
00:25:13,771 --> 00:25:17,085
multiple occasions, and he
probably should have done.

694
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,065
But, without Chimoff I

695
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:20,130
think none of us would have
stayed at the company.

696
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,080
We were a really weird bunch
of people, but

697
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,400
it worked out.

698
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,060
And, the two things we did,
I think, that really,

699
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,980
really drove growth
initially, was number one,

700
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,060
we focused on that ten
friends in 14 days and

701
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,250
getting users to the magic
moment.

702
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,170
And that was something Zuck
drove,

703
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,100
cuz we were all stuck in
analysis paralysis,

704
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,060
saying is it causation, is
it correlation.

705
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,390
Zuck was like, you really
think if no one

706
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,460
gets a friend that they'll
be active on Facebook?

707
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,110
Are you crazy?

708
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,850
The second thing was
internationalization.

709
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,240
It was knocking down another
barrier.

710
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,450
And when we launched it, I
think there were

711
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,380
two things that we did
really well.

712
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,450
Number one was, even though
we were late, and

713
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,330
we were stressed about being
late,

714
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,660
we took the time to build it
in a scalable way.

715
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,900
We moved slow to move fast.

716
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,790
And you can actually read,

717
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,870
hear the full story from
Naomi in one of

718
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,060
the videos linked from the
lecture page.

719
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,950
But what we did was we
wrapped all the strings in

720
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,840
the site in FPT which our
translation script, and

721
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,730
then, or translation
extraction script, and then,

722
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,220
we created the community
translation platform.

723
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,390
So that we didn't just have

724
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,420
professional translators
translating a site we

725
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,330
could have all of our users
translating a site.

726
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,350
And we got French translated
in 12 hours, but

727
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,280
we managed to get to this
day we are now at

728
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,182
104 languages translated by
Facebook for Facebook.

729
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:40,470
80 plus 70 of those are
translated by the community.

730
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,330
And we took the time to

731
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,980
build something that would
enable us to scale.

732
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,920
The other thing is we

733
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,810
prioritized the right
languages.

734
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,390
So back then the right
languages,

735
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,200
the big four languages were
French, Italian, German and

736
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,530
Spanish, figs and Chinese,
but

737
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,260
we were blocked in China.

738
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:01,428
>> So we focused on French,
Italian, German,

739
00:27:01,428 --> 00:27:02,870
and Spanish.

740
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,670
Now look at that list,

741
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,520
that's today's distribution
of languages.

742
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,090
Italian isn't on the list
anymore.

743
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,050
French and German are about
to fall off.

744
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,100
In the last year we
quadrupled the number of

745
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,700
people on Facebook in Hindi,
quadrupled.

746
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,840
And so building for

747
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,910
where the world is today, is
an easy mistake to make and

748
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,450
it's what a lot of the other
social networks did.

749
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,630
We built a scalable
translation infrastructure

750
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,880
that actually enabled us to
attack all of the languages,

751
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,760
so we can be ready for

752
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,420
where the future is going
to, is gonna be.

753
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,560
And you'll probably be able
to see some stuff

754
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,370
from our Internet.org Summit
in India about where we

755
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,595
want to go with language
translations later today,

756
00:27:39,595 --> 00:27:41,320
cuz I think they're talking
about that stuff there.

757
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,860
So these are the tactics I
wanna go through now, and

758
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,970
I'll stick with the white
board for that stuff.

759
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,040
But I'd really encourage you
guys as I go through these,

760
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,140
if you've got any questions
about them let me know.

761
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,570
I think this should be like,

762
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,380
a more free form time
anyway.

763
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,110
But I think some these

764
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,060
tactics are quite
interesting.

765
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,340
So Virality.

766
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:03,551
Yes, I think there are two
ways to look at virality.

767
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:07,606
There's a great book whoops,
the book on the right here,

768
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,749
by Adam Penenberg, Viral
Loop,

769
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:13,193
goes through a bunch of case
studies of companies that

770
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,160
have grown through viral
marketing.

771
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,140
And I strongly encourage
you, if

772
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,160
you're interested in viral
marketing, to get that book.

773
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,012
I think Ogilvy on
Advertising's great as well

774
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,196
because chapter seven he's
like if you can't think of

775
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:25,142
anything else stick a car to
a billboard with

776
00:28:25,142 --> 00:28:27,560
super glue and people will
buy your super glue.

777
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,372
And he's got some really,

778
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:30,030
he's got some really good
creative tips in there.

779
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,023
>> Like the, the guy's been
dead 20 years and I think he

780
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:35,951
still, I, I buy everyone on
my team gets both of these

781
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:38,406
books when they start on my
team.

782
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:39,470
So virality.

783
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,450
So Sean Park has this model
that he taught or he

784
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,530
told us about when he, when,
when I joined Facebook.

785
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,560
Which is to think about
virality for

786
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,610
a product in terms of three
things.

787
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,650
First is payload.

788
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,390
So how many people can you
hit with any

789
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,326
given viral blast?

790
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:04,702
Second, he had cooler words
for

791
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,841
these, I'm not quite as
cool.

792
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:13,100
Second is conversion rate,
and third is frequency.

793
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,230
Payload frequency and

794
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,480
conversion rate, whatever,
that order.

795
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,640
So, how many people can you
hit at once is payload.

796
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,890
How many times can you hit
them per blast is frequency.

797
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,130
And what are they gonna
convert at?

798
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,180
And that gives you

799
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,870
a fundamental idea of how
viral a product is.

800
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,074
So Hotmail is like, the
canonical example of

801
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,730
brilliant viral marketing,
right?

802
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,840
Back when Hotmail launched,

803
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,000
there were a bunch of mail
companies that had

804
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,320
been funded and they were
throwing huge amounts of

805
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,170
money at traditional
advertising.

806
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,570
How many people know the
Hotmail story, of virality?

807
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,570
Awesome, great, new
audience, sorry.

808
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,859
Those two or three people
will be bored.

809
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,161
But Hotmail back in, back at
that time.

810
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,923
People couldn't get free
email clients,

811
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,000
they had to be tied to their
ISP.

812
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,650
And Hotmail and a few other
companies launched and

813
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,550
their clients were available
wherever you went.

814
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,410
You could log in via library
internet or whatever,

815
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,690
school internet, and be able
to get access to that.

816
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,140
Which was a really big value
proposition for

817
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,050
everyone, who wanted to
access it.

818
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,770
Most of the companies, went
out there and

819
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,760
did big TV campaigns and
billboard campaigns and

820
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,740
newspaper campaigns and

821
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,050
things like that forced a
lot of advertising of Yahoo,

822
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,320
all of those things.

823
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,040
But the Hotmail team didn't
have as much funding, and so

824
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,440
they had to scrabble around
to figure out how to do it.

825
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,050
So, what they did was add
that little link at

826
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,390
the bottom of every email
that said,

827
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,090
sent from Hotmail, get your
free email here.

828
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,000
Now, the interesting thing
is that meant

829
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
the payload was low.

830
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,580
Right, you email one person
at a time,

831
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,740
not necessarily gonna have a
huge payload.

832
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,710
Maybe you send around some
of those viral spam emails.

833
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,170
But then I'm not sure I'll
click on your link.

834
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,090
The frequency is high,
though because you're

835
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,680
emailing the same people
over and over and over.

836
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,060
Which means you're gonna hit
them once,

837
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,130
twice, three times a day
with that same link and

838
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,260
really move up the
impressions.

839
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,290
And the conversion rate was
also very high because

840
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,370
people didn't like being
tied to their ISP email.

841
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,020
And so Hotmail ended up
being

842
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,540
extremely viral because it
had high frequency and

843
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,420
high conversion rates.

844
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,690
Another example is PayPal.

845
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,880
PayPal, PayPal is
interesting because PayPal

846
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,490
has two sites to it.

847
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,320
PayPal has the buyer and the
seller site.

848
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,190
The other thing that's
interesting about PayPal is

849
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,050
its mechanism for viral
growth was eBay.

850
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,670
And so you can use all kinds
of things for

851
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,090
virality that may not look
necessarily obviously viral.

852
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,640
So PayPal, if you sent
money,

853
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,290
if you said to a seller, I
am going to send you money.

854
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:43,800
Like, I can't think of a
higher conversion rate.

855
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,360
Frequency was low, payload
was low, but

856
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,110
PayPal did this thing, where
they gave away money when

857
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,840
you got your friends to sign
up for PayPal, and

858
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,180
so that's how they went
viral on the consumer side.

859
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,380
They didn't have to do that
for sellers,

860
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,080
because if I said I'm gonna
send you money via this,

861
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,750
you will take that.

862
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,400
And even on the consumer
side they

863
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,990
went viral because someone
said sign up for

864
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,610
this thing and you'll get 10
bucks.

865
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,640
Why wouldn't you?

866
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,260
So, they were able to go
viral, but

867
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,410
in both cases it was because
their conversion rate was

868
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,030
incredibly high on the buyer
and the seller side.

869
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,720
No.

870
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,030
Because their payload and
frequency was high.

871
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:16,560
Makes sense?

872
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,440
So this is a really good way
to look at virality if

873
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,560
you wanna say, is this
product viral?

874
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,340
Facebook was not viral via
email sharing or

875
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,700
anything like that.

876
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,180
Facebook was purely viral by
a word of mouth.

877
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,580
Because the interesting
thing about PayPal and

878
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,770
Hotmail Is to use them the
first person had to

879
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,980
send an email to someone who
wasn't on the service.

880
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,890
With Facebook there's no

881
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,250
native way to contact people
who aren't on the service.

882
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,680
Everyone thinks of Facebook
as viral marketing success,

883
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,130
and that's actually, not how
it grew.

884
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,130
It was word of mouth
virality, because it was an

885
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,110
awesome product you wanted
to tell your friends about.

886
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:55,860
How's everyone doing?

887
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,770
Is this interesting?

888
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,505
Great, question, yes.

889
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
>> So when you're talking
about this low pay

890
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
load in both of the
examples.

891
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,330
In the later rounds as this
sort of campaign or

892
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,480
whatever you want to call it
gets going.

893
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,542
Aren't you going to have a
much higher pay load as

894
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:11,806
more and more people are
sending Hotmail] to more and

895
00:33:11,806 --> 00:33:13,818
more folks, and that way
your pay load grows and

896
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:15,090
grows and grows?

897
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,610
So, the question is in the
first round it

898
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,170
makes sense that it has a
low pay load, but

899
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,640
in later rounds, aren't you
gonna have higher pay

900
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,410
loads as people send more
and more and more emails.

901
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,760
I guess in my head, well,
first and

902
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,170
foremost, I think you
actually,

903
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,200
only send emails to a small
number of people.

904
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,640
So, compared to like the
massive viral engines that

905
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,210
exist today,

906
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,370
where you import someone's
entire contact book.

907
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,690
And send them all.

908
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,810
Send them all an email, or

909
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,490
where you post to everyone's
friends on Facebook.

910
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,280
The actual payloads are
still very small.

911
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,350
Even if it's everyone that

912
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,700
you email on a frequent
basis you hit.

913
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm also thinking really per
email sent out.

914
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,290
How many people are on it?

915
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,640
But it's a fair point, like
yeah, as more people get on,

916
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,260
get on Hotmail they'll send
more emails,

917
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,560
as more people use email.

918
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,670
The product actually, grows
more and more successfully.

919
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,770
So, that's a fair point.

920
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,370
Go for it.

921
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,480
>> Doesn't, like, point of
conversion also matter?

922
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,990
So, like, when just click
and sign up.

923
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,399
But if you skip the goal ad
it's

924
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,490
>> Completely agree,

925
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,060
that's why, oh I'm sorry.

926
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,850
Doesn't point to conversion
matters as well, so

927
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,800
on Hotmail, you click to
sign up, but on a billboard

928
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,830
you have to remember that
the URL goes to the website,

929
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,470
type it in, find the
registration button,

930
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,620
click register and sign up.

931
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,380
Yes.

932
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,570
Yes, anything you can do to
move friction out of

933
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,690
the flow.

934
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,420
And going from an offline ad
to an online ad removes huge

935
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,920
amounts of frictions from
the flow.

936
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,630
Obviously.

937
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,740
Totally agree with that.

938
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,315
One more at the back.

939
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:29,150
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion related?

940
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,280
>> Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

941
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,170
Absolutely.

942
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,870
If you hit someone with the
same promotion,

943
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,940
I repeated that.

944
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Aren't frequency and
conversion rate related?

945
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,590
If you hit someone with the
same email over and over and

946
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,500
over again.

947
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,300
All the same banner ads,
this is one of the things

948
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,520
that's fundamental about
online marketing.

949
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,280
The same rules apply to
every channel.

950
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,600
If you hit someone with the
same Facebook ad over, and

951
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,280
over, and over, the more
times you

952
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,700
hit them with the same ad
the less they'll click.

953
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,250
That's why we have creative
exhaustion you have to

954
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,990
rotate creatives on
Facebook.

955
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,230
Same with banner ads, same
with news feed stories.

956
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,360
The fiftieth time you see
the IQ story in

957
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,110
your news feed, you are not
gonna click on it.

958
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,500
If you haven't clicked on
the 49 before,

959
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,700
you're not gonna click on
the 50th.

960
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,560
The same is absolutely true
with these emails.

961
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,530
So, if you send the same
email over and

962
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,300
over and over to people for
an invite.

963
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,700
Or if you send the same
little link at

964
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,730
the bottom over and over and
over to people for Hotmail.

965
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,630
Or I mean the PayPal one's

966
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,240
different because people
just signed up.

967
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,370
But yes, you will get lower
conversion rate.

968
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,160
And the more you hit someone
with

969
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,100
the same message the less
they convert.

970
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,010
Is fundamental across every
online marketing channel,

971
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,290
every online marketing
channel, cool.

972
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,670
Second way, to look at
virality,

973
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,120
which I think is awesome, is
by this guy Ed.

974
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,950
And Ed runs the growth team
at Uber now,

975
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,230
he was at the growth team at
Facebook.

976
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,870
And he was a Stanford MBA
student, and

977
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:49,410
did a class similar to this,

978
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,460
where they talked about
virility.

979
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,420
And they all went and built
viral products.

980
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,200
And there was a bunch of
press about that actually.

981
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,950
And these brilliance of
these stuff.

982
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,900
The interesting thing about
Uber.

983
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,800
If you look at there growth
team

984
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,160
they're incredibly focused
on drivers.

985
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:00,750
Because it's a two

986
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,530
sided market place they need
drivers.

987
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:05,210
That's a huge, huge chunk of
their focus as a team.

988
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,990
Even they've got like
probably the best viral guy

989
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,060
in the world at the company.

990
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,260
So, with virality,

991
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,870
you get someone to contact
import, let's say.

992
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,140
Then the question is,

993
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,970
how many of those people do
you get to send imports?

994
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,630
Then the question is, to how
many people?

995
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,120
Then, how many click?

996
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,730
And you can put extra steps
in this.

997
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,170
You could put how many open,
how many click, whatever.

998
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,410
How many click, how many
sign up.

999
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,390
And then how many of those
import.

1000
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,140
So essentially, you want
people who sign up to

1001
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,270
your site, to import their
contacts.

1002
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,590
You want to then get them to
send an invite to all of

1003
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,850
those contacts.

1004
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,350
You want to get.

1005
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,490
It to all of those contacts,
not just one of them.

1006
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,920
Then you want to get a
percentage of those to

1007
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,960
click, and a percentage of
those to sign up.

1008
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,330
If you multiply out the
percents at every point in

1009
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,150
this, this is essentially,

1010
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,340
where well this isn't a
percent, this is a number.

1011
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,470
If you multiply those out,

1012
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,680
that's essentially, the
point where you

1013
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,010
get to the question of what
is the k factor.

1014
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,670
So, if you have, when
someone imports if on

1015
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,708
average they send invites to
100 people.

1016
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:24,790
Sorry doing that wrong,
let's say 100

1017
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,970
people get an invite per
person who imports.

1018
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,039
And then of those 10% click.

1019
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,930
That gets you to 10.

1020
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,370
And then, of those, let's
say, 50% sign up.

1021
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,920
That gets you to 5.

1022
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,648
And then, of those,

1023
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:43,090
only 10 to 20% actually,
subsequently import.

1024
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,360
You're gonna be at a point
where you're at 0.5 to 1 as

1025
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,700
your K factor.

1026
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,400
And you're gonna not be
viral.

1027
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,270
So, a lot of things like
Vidi are very good at

1028
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,070
pumping, or were very good
at pumping out stories.

1029
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,210
They got the cave factor
over one, and it's perfectly

1030
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,450
doable to get the cave
factor over one, but

1031
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,320
if you have something that
doesn't have high retention

1032
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,620
on the back end then it
doesn't really matter.

1033
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,840
So, you should look at your
invite flow and

1034
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,999
say, what is my equivalent
import?

1035
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,330
How many people, per import,
are invites sent to?

1036
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,320
How many of those receive
clicks?

1037
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,170
How many of those convert to
my site?

1038
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,980
How many of those then
import?

1039
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,380
To get an idea of your k
factor.

1040
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,970
But the really,

1041
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,300
important thing is still to
think about retention, and

1042
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,570
not to think about virality.

1043
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:31,670
And only do this after you
have a large

1044
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,620
number of people retained on
your product per person

1045
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,180
who signs up.

1046
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,308
So, couple more things we
were gonna touch on.

1047
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:44,210
SEO, email, SMS and push
notifications.

1048
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,710
So, in SEO,

1049
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,390
there are three things you
need to think about.

1050
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,250
First one is keyword
research.

1051
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,740
People do this badly all the
time.

1052
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,980
So I launched this cocktail
site that I

1053
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,860
talked to you about.

1054
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,730
I spent a year optimizing it
to rank for

1055
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,040
the word cocktail making.

1056
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,650
Turns out in the UK no one
searches for

1057
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,640
cocktail making.

1058
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,660
About 500 people a month.

1059
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,970
I dominated that search
term.

1060
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,490
It was awesome.

1061
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,480
>> I got 400 visitors a
month.

1062
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,780
It was amazing.

1063
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,480
Everyone searches for
cocktail recipes In the UK.

1064
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,110
And in the US, which is the
biggest market,

1065
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,020
everyone searches for drink
recipes.

1066
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,890
So I optimize for the wrong
word.

1067
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,410
So you've gotta do

1068
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,000
your research first about
what you're gonna go after.

1069
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,670
So, research consists of
what do people search for

1070
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,100
that's related to your
sites, how many people

1071
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,940
search for it, how many
other people are ranking for

1072
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,856
it, and how valuable is it
for you.

1073
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:32,260
Supply, demands and value.

1074
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
Simple economics I guess.

1075
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,510
So you do your keyword
research.

1076
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,940
You figure out which
keywords you

1077
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,260
want to rank for.

1078
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,410
There are great tools out
there to

1079
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,450
enable you to do that.

1080
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,240
Honestly the best is quite
often the Google AdWords,

1081
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
keyword planner tool.

1082
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,140
Really.

1083
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,380
Once you've done, that

1084
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,260
the next most important
thing is links.

1085
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,550
So, page rank is how all of
SEO is essentially,

1086
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,840
is driven and Google is
based on authority.

1087
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,550
Now there's a lot of other
things in Google's

1088
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,880
algorithm now like do people
search for your website?

1089
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,720
There's a lot stuff about
the distribution of what

1090
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,960
the anchor text is.

1091
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,130
That's send to your site.

1092
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,070
So, if you abuse it and

1093
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,120
spam it they can pop up with
spam.

1094
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,390
White on a white background
five pages below the fold

1095
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,300
doesn't work anymore.

1096
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,470
But, the single most
important thing is to

1097
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,120
get valuable links from

1098
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,980
high authority websites
future ranking Google.

1099
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
Most important thing.

1100
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,050
Then you need to distribute
that log inside your site,

1101
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,550
by internally linking
effectively.

1102
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,670
And when I joined Facebook.

1103
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,596
We'd launched SEO in
September 2007,

1104
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,890
which was before I joined.

1105
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,960
I joined November 2007.

1106
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,510
And we'd launched it, and we
were getting no traffic from

1107
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,470
the pages we'd launched,
public user profiles.

1108
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,680
So, when I went in and
looked at it.

1109
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,100
The only way you could get
to any public user

1110
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,290
profile was to click on the
footer of the page, for

1111
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:49,909
the about link.

1112
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,660
Then click on one of the
blog articles,

1113
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,050
then click on one of the
authors, and then spider out

1114
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,506
through their friends to get
to all their friends.

1115
00:40:57,506 --> 00:40:58,530
Turns out that,

1116
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,290
Google was like they buried
these papers,

1117
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,520
they're not very valuable,
and

1118
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,080
we're not going to rank
them.

1119
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,850
We made one change.

1120
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,640
We added a directory so that
Google could quickly get to

1121
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,190
every page on the site.

1122
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,440
And we 100 xd SEO traffic.

1123
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,010
Very, very simple change
drove a lot of

1124
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,940
upside about distributing
the link love internally.

1125
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,200
And then the last thing is
there's a bunch of

1126
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,120
table stakes stuff, HML
sitemaps,

1127
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,850
making sure you have the
right headers, it's all

1128
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,360
covered really well online
for what you wanna do.

1129
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm gonna stop now and make
sure, cuz we have

1130
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,260
a few questions, but, what
other questions are there?

1131
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,650
Go for it.

1132
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,260
>> We're going to email
actually,.

1133
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,500
>> Let's go into email.

1134
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,130
Okay great.

1135
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,340
Email is dead for people
under 25 in my opinion.

1136
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,520
Right?
Young people don't

1137
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,610
use email.

1138
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,600
They use WhatsApp, they use
SMS,

1139
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,690
they use Snapchat, they use
Facebook.

1140
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,750
They don't use email.

1141
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,270
If you're targeting an older
audience, email is,

1142
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,360
pretty successful.

1143
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,070
Email still works for
distribution, but

1144
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,190
realistically, email is not
that great for

1145
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,990
teenagers, especially, and
even people at university.

1146
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,950
You know, how much you use
instant messaging apps and

1147
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,370
how little you use email.

1148
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,100
And you guys are probably,

1149
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,200
on the high end of the scale
for email,

1150
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,119
because you're in Silicon
Valley.

1151
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,290
That being said, on email
the things to think about.

1152
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,750
Email, SMS, and

1153
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,010
push notifications all
behave the same way.

1154
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,980
They all have questions of
deliverability.

1155
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,080
So to finish first, first
you have to finish.

1156
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,640
Your email has to get to
someones inbox.

1157
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,330
So if you send a lot of spam
and

1158
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,180
you end up with dirty IP's,
or you send spam from

1159
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,820
shared servers where other
people are.

1160
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,270
Or if you send email
notifications, from shared

1161
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,060
servers where other people
are sending spam from,

1162
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,030
you are gonna end up being
put in the spam folder

1163
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,150
consistently, and your email
will fail completely.

1164
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,530
You may end up, being
blocked and

1165
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,070
have your email bounce.

1166
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,580
There's a lot of

1167
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,690
stuff around email where you
have to look.

1168
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,000
When you receive feedback
from the servers you

1169
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,510
are sending email too.

1170
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,990
500 series errors versus 400
series errors,

1171
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:52,180
you have to be respectful of
how those are handled.

1172
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,440
If someone gives you a hard
bounce, retry once or

1173
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,590
twice and, then stop trying.

1174
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,250
Because if you are someone
who abuses people's inboxes,

1175
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,350
the email companies spam
folder you and

1176
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,810
it's very hard to get out.

1177
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,690
If you get caught, on a
Spamhaus link, or

1178
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,340
anything like that, it's
very hard to get out.

1179
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,190
It's really important with
email,

1180
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,470
that you are a high-class
citizen,

1181
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,300
that you do good work with
email because you want to

1182
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,420
have deliverability for the
long run.

1183
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,910
That counts for push
notifications and SMS2.

1184
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,390
With SMS, you can go and buy
SMS traffic, via gray routes

1185
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,250
with people with their
having phones strung up.

1186
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,730
Attached to a like computer
and pumping out SMS's.

1187
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,520
That works for a time but it
always get shut down.

1188
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,200
And I've seen so

1189
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,100
many companies make these
mistakes.

1190
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,270
Where they think they're
gonna grow

1191
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,960
by using these kind of
tactics.

1192
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,840
If you can't get your email,
your SMS or

1193
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,120
your push delivered.

1194
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,830
You will never get any
success from these.

1195
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,950
Push, you spam your power
users, I know

1196
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,250
that's slightly different to
what I said earlier.

1197
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,160
But you actually, spam your
power users and

1198
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,100
give them notifications that
they don't care about and

1199
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,600
make it really hard for them
to opt out.

1200
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,160
So, there's no settings
where they can opt out,

1201
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,830
and they start blocking you.

1202
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,960
You can never push them
once,

1203
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,520
they've opted out of your
push notifications.

1204
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,690
And it's very hard actually,
to prompt them to

1205
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,860
turn them on once they've
turned them off.

1206
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,340
So, number one thing to
think about about email,

1207
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,020
SMS, and

1208
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,100
push notification is you
have to get them delivered.

1209
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,660
Beyond that,

1210
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,510
it's a question of open
rate, click through rate.

1211
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,470
So, what is the compelling
subject line you

1212
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,360
can put there.

1213
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,430
So, that people are gonna
open your email.

1214
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,050
And how can you get them to
click when they visit?

1215
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,880
Everyone focuses towards
doing,

1216
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,850
marketing email that are
just spam.

1217
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,300
In my opinion Newsletters
are stupid.

1218
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,180
Don't do newsletters,
because you'll

1219
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,250
send the same message to
everyone on your site.

1220
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,960
Someone, who signed up

1221
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,760
to your site yesterday
versus someone,

1222
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,860
who's been using your
product for three years.

1223
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,980
Do they need the same
message?

1224
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,070
No.

1225
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,930
The most effective email you
can do is notifications.

1226
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,840
So, what are you sending?

1227
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,540
What should you be notifying
people of?

1228
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,300
And this is a great place
where we're in

1229
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,590
the wrong mindset.

1230
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,270
As a Facebook user I don't
want Facebook to email me

1231
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,910
about every like I receive,
because I receive a lot of

1232
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,430
likes cuz I've got a bunch
of Facebook friends.

1233
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,120
But as a new Facebook user,

1234
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,190
that first like you receive
is a magic moment.

1235
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,010
Turning on that notification
across all of

1236
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,500
of our channels, increased
the click through rate

1237
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
on our email, SMS and
push-notifications.

1238
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,620
But we only turned it on,
for low-engaged users who

1239
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,820
weren't coming back to the
site so

1240
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,170
it wouldn't be spamming
them.

1241
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:24,120
So, it was a great
experience.

1242
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,730
To think about that.

1243
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,890
What notifications should we
be sending

1244
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:30,050
is the first thing you need
to think about on email,

1245
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,170
SMS, and push.

1246
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,790
And then the second thing
you need to

1247
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,900
be thinking about is.

1248
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,180
How can you create great

1249
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,620
triggered marketing
campaigns?

1250
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,570
So, when someone creates
their first,

1251
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,280
cross border trade
transaction was one of

1252
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,240
the best email campaigns, I
was ever part of at eBay in

1253
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,170
terms of click-through
rates.

1254
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,180
It was awesome.

1255
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,590
Because it was really
timely,

1256
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,260
really in context the right
thing to do for the user.

1257
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,440
So I'd say, make sure you
have deliverability.

1258
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,880
Most important thing.

1259
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,690
Focus on notifications and
trigger based email,

1260
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,220
SMS, and push notifications
beyond that.

1261
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,760
So, I think we're out of
time.

1262
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,679
There's one thing I wanted
to finish with which is.

1263
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,180
And if you guys have any
questions, I guess, like,

1264
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:07,810
you can reach me and

1265
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,120
if I get spammed, I just
won't reply.

1266
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:12,360
We have great spam filters,

1267
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,740
no, my only favorite quotes
is from General Patton,

1268
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,940
and it's so cliche it's
crazy but it's awesome.

1269
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,260
A good plan, violently
executed today is

1270
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,600
better than a perfect plan
tomorrow and

1271
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,330
one of the things the most
instilled in us.

1272
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,030
And Harvey still instills in
us and Mark instills across

1273
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,780
the whole of Facebook is
this move fast and

1274
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,430
don't be afraid to break
stuff ethos.

1275
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,120
If you can run more
experiments than

1276
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,500
the next guy, if you can be
hungry for growth.

1277
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,680
If you fight and die for
every extra user.

1278
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,120
And you stay up late at
night to get those extra

1279
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,570
users to run those
experiments to

1280
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,270
get the data and do it over
and over and over again.

1281
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,880
You will grow faster.

1282
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,260
Marcus said he thinks we won
'cause we wanted it more,

1283
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,990
and I really believe that.

1284
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,210
We just worked really hard.

1285
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,770
It's not like we're crazy
smart, or

1286
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,300
we've all done these crazy
things before.

1287
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,830
We just worked really,
really hard,

1288
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,110
and we executed fast.

1289
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,700
And I strongly encourage you
to do that.

1290
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,538
Growth is optional.

1291
00:47:06,538 --> 00:47:14,900
Thank you.

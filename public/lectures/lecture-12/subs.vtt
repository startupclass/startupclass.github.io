WEBVTT

00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.040
Can we keep playing, wait,
okay good.

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:10.845
Can we turn it up a little
bit, so it&#39;s more pumped up?

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:11.846
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s loud.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.514
&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go, okay.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.774
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we gotta find
the beat and

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:21.999
then we gotta clap to the
beat.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.594
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:27.361
All right.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:31.632
Okay, that&#39;s pretty good
guys.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:32.333
All right, we&#39;re good.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:32.833
We&#39;re good.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:33.634
Thank you.

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:34.869
Okay, please stop.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:36.303
Okay, stop the music.

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:36.803
Thank you.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.049
Okay, cool.
Can you put on

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.141
the presentation, thank you.

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:43.508
&gt;&gt; That&#39;ll be the most
pumped up

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:45.734
thing that ever happens in
enterprise software, so

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:48.223
the rest is sort of downhill
from here.

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; So, thank you for that
intro,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.320
that well-rehearsed intro,
thank you.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:57.381
&gt;&gt; Confirming the facts as
you&#39;re saying them,

00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:58.600
very good.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.744
So I&#39;m Aaron Levie, CEO and
co-founder of Box.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:06.078
Welcome to this edition of
how to

00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:11.570
build an enterprise software
company.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.350
That&#39;s my understanding.
This is the course that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.110
you&#39;re taking, right, is
that correct?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.378
&gt;&gt; No, okay, so.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.750
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s my job today.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.820
My job is to try and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.210
convince you that everybody
else who speaks throughout

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.040
this whole class is wrong
and that you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.060
actually wanna build an
enterprise software company.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.620
And so hopefully we&#39;ll be
able to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.900
kinda work through this, and
you&#39;ll have a good sense of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.740
why it&#39;s super cool to be in
the enterprise.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.570
And why a lot of the
perceptions of

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.710
going into the whole
consumer space, where it&#39;s,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.300
you know, so much fun and
everything.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.520
Why that&#39;s wrong and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.000
why you wanna do enterprise
software.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.260
Who wants to build an
enterprise software company?

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.230
Good, all right.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.420
Thank you very much.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.782
Hopefully we&#39;ll do a vote at
the end and

00:01:53.782 --> 00:01:56.740
hopefully that will not have
shrunk.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.890
So that&#39;s really actually
the only goal I

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.070
have at this point.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.380
So, we&#39;re gonna talk about
three things today.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.780
The first is the quick
background and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.980
history of Box.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.980
Cuz when we started the
company, we didn&#39;t know that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.960
we wanted to do enterprise
software and so I wanna kind

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.310
of get through a little bit
about why we decided to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.880
go after the enterprise and
what we do today.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.350
And then I&#39;m gonna talk a
little bit

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.050
about what are the major
kind of factors that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.600
have changed in enterprise
software that make it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.880
possible to do a start up
today in this category.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.360
And then finally we&#39;ll talk
a little

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.420
about some patterns that you
can kind of exploit and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.770
some ways to recognize and
ways to actually go

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.860
build an enterprise software
company yourself and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.760
hopefully that&#39;ll be some
practical, useful advice.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.890
Just as a forewarning, my
voice,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.848
as I&#39;ve been speaking a lot
the past couple days.

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:51.600
So hopefully, I&#39;ll be able
to get to that third part of

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.120
the advice and actually be
able to talk, so we&#39;ll see

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.520
how we make it but I&#39;m gonna
be downing a lot of water so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.300
I apologize for that.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.420
So building for the
enterprise.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.020
This is what we&#39;re gonna
talk about.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.668
So just quick kinda high
level stats about Box.

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:07.884
We&#39;ve about 240,000
businesses that use

00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:09.080
the product.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.402
There are over 27 million
users that have brought Box

00:03:12.402 --> 00:03:15.723
into their organization and
used it as individuals and

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:18.550
we&#39;re in about 99% of the
Fortune 500.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.340
Unfortunately that last 1%
is really just Microsoft.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.539
And they don&#39;t seem to wanna
buy from us.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.930
So.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.452
&gt;&gt; We have to work on that a
little bit.

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.630
But certainly, a decent
amount of scale,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.050
a lot of users that have
brought Box into

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.870
enterprise environments,
these are some of

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.120
the large organizations that
are using the product.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.980
So, a very wide range of
industries, everything from

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.290
manufacturing and consumer
products to companies like

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.910
General Electric.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.960
Stanford Healthcare actually
uses the product for

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.370
collaboration within the
hospital environments and

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.600
the research.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.510
But between healthcare,
media, manufacturing.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.740
These are the sort of the
range of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.997
industries that we serve.

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:02.660
So, the question&#39;s how did
we get here?

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.902
Cuz we didn&#39;t really start
the company to try and

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:06.982
go build an enterprise
software company even

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:09.780
though that is how things
ended up happening.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.430
So when we started the
product, so

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.070
we launched the company in
2005.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.740
We got the idea actually in
college back in 2004.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.760
And so, was anybody using
the internet back in 2004?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.260
Okay great.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.440
So basically, I don&#39;t know
if

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.750
millennials use the internet
back then.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.260
Sorry.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.971
Okay, no more age jokes.

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.772
All right, here&#39;s the point.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:34.959
So, back in 2004, you might
remember that there wasn&#39;t

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.377
a lot to do on the internet.

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:37.629
It was actually kind of
boring right?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.160
This is before Facebook.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.220
This is certainly before
Snapchat.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.680
So not a lot of things that
you could go to,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.230
you couldn&#39;t send people 15
second messages and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.220
photos that disappeared,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.090
cuz you didn&#39;t even have a
phone to send them photos.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.470
So in the internet in 2004,
there wasn&#39;t a lot going on.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.090
This was basically what the
internet looked like.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.240
Sort of a barren, deserted
landscape and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.770
this was the internet and
just to clarify,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.049
the happy camel&#39;s Google and
the sad camel&#39;s Yahoo!

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:07.677
&gt;&gt; And that was effectively
the internet and

00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:11.115
this is accurate, this is
the internet in 2004.

00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:13.240
Yahoo has done a lot better
since then but,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.300
but back in the middle 2000s

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.360
they were certainly trying
to find their way and

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.500
Google was sort of taking
over the world but

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.300
this was the entire, this
was the extent of the world.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.403
So, what we noticed in 2004
in college was that it was,

00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:27.263
for some reason, and this
isn&#39;t so

00:05:27.263 --> 00:05:28.441
much the case today but

00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:31.530
back in 2004 it was like,
really hard to share files.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.960
And as simple of an idea as
that is now, you go back

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.730
ten years and it was either
really expensive or

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.390
it was really hard to

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.755
move data through different
corporate networks.

00:05:42.755 --> 00:05:44.870
So I had an internship at
the time,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.380
and in the internship, most
of my job using data was

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.080
actually just to copy
printed out pages and

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.160
then put them in cabinets.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.550
That&#39;s what you do

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.990
as an intern if you&#39;re not a
computer science student.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.595
So I was really, really good
at copying paper.

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:06.640
And unfortunately not a
skill that has

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.045
really been useful today.

00:06:08.045 --> 00:06:10.060
But, it was really hard to
share files and

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.980
then in classroom
environments you

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.950
were constantly working with
lots of other people and

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.370
it was also hard to share
files.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.860
I went to USC.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.560
And USC gave you 50
megabytes of online storage

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.010
space in your email account.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.920
50 megabytes.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.760
So you can basically store
about one file and

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.210
then it would auto-delete
every six months.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.390
I don&#39;t know who was running
IT at the time but

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.520
they certainly didn&#39;t buy
hard drives.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.320
So, there was just really,
really hard to store and

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.880
share files.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.260
And so we said, well,

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.380
why don&#39;t we make it really
easy to store and

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.320
share files from anywhere?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.100
And so we got this idea for,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.230
at the time it was called
box.net.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.380
And what we noticed was
there were a bunch of

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.040
factors that had changed in
the software world.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.720
The first was that the cost
of storage was sort of

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.010
dropping dramatically.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.490
So, in our business,
basically every year or

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.450
two, you can double the
amount of data and

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.122
storage that goes in to a
hard drive.

00:07:07.122 --> 00:07:12.390
So, what was uneconomical
two or three years ago,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.040
all of the sudden becomes
feasible because the cost of

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.580
computing and the cost of
storage has dropped.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.076
We had more powerful
browsers and networks so

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:24.618
Firefox was just emerging,
people were using the much

00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:27.159
faster internet in both
their homes and

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.840
in the classroom.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.810
And then people had more
locations that they

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.400
wanted to store and share
information from.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.740
And so we had these sort of
three factors that all of

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.300
a sudden were emerging.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.490
And I&#39;m gonna sort of pull
these factors back

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.850
later when I give some sort
of tactical advice but

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.210
sort of the first point to
remember is, always look for

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.180
these changing technology
factors.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.823
Cuz any market that has a
significant change in

00:07:48.823 --> 00:07:51.196
the underlying, either raw
materials or

00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:54.180
enabling factors is an
environment that&#39;s about to

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.167
change in a very significant
way.

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:59.553
And so we were very
fortunate that basically

00:07:59.553 --> 00:08:02.846
the need for data in the
cloud was growing in

00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:05.133
importance, and the cost and

00:08:05.133 --> 00:08:09.560
the feasibility of doing it
was also improving rapidly.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.918
And so we decided to put
together this really quick

00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:14.219
version of Box, we launched
it as box.net, and

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:17.800
the idea was, let&#39;s make it
really easy to share files.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.380
And it turned out that the
idea clicked.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.320
We got angel funding from
this guy named Mark Cuban.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.110
And this was before Shark
Tank, but

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.520
it was very similar.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.120
And so, we got this funding,
and we decided that, okay.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.790
This is gonna be super
exciting.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.060
We are going to drop out of
college.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.450
We&#39;re gonna move to the Bay
Area, and

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.510
it&#39;s gonna be totally
awesome.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.460
And when you drop out of
college.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.130
Anybody drop out of college
yet?

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.565
Okay, good, stay in school.

00:08:41.565 --> 00:08:44.340
So when you drop out of
college, like everyone sort

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.090
of pictures it, it&#39;s just
gonna be, you know,

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.750
incredible, like Bill Gates
dropped out of college.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.012
It will be like Bill Gates,
or

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:51.676
Michael Dell dropped out of
college and

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:53.695
it&#39;ll be super exciting like
Michael Dell, or

00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:55.309
Steve Jobs dropped out of
college, so

00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:56.970
this is what people imagine.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.270
But nobody ever remembers
that this guy dropped out of

00:08:59.270 --> 00:08:59.890
college also.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.160
&gt;&gt; And, so it&#39;s not really a
guarantee obviously that

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.085
it&#39;s gonna be successful.

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:09.290
But, it&#39;s what you do, and
actually, funny,

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.130
I don&#39;t even know if this
guy dropped out of college.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.510
&gt;&gt; It just sort of looks
like he had to.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.787
&gt;&gt; I apologize if anyone&#39;s
related to him,

00:09:19.787 --> 00:09:21.261
it&#39;s just a funny picture on
the internet.

00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:22.629
So.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:24.744
&gt;&gt; So basically we decided
we would drop out of

00:09:24.744 --> 00:09:25.280
college.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.670
We moved up to first Berkley
and

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.245
then we moved to Palo Alto a
little bit thereafter.

00:09:30.245 --> 00:09:33.427
And we decided that we were
gonna open up the product

00:09:33.427 --> 00:09:34.100
for free.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.920
We got hundreds of thousands
of people that would sign up

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.470
for the product every single
month.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.533
So, we had a free version of
the product called,

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:45.893
if you went to box.net, you
got a free one gigabyte of

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.986
file storage space, which
was,

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:51.224
again, quite a bit back in
2006 at this point.

00:09:51.224 --> 00:09:53.097
But we were getting so many
users and

00:09:53.097 --> 00:09:56.099
we were trying to figure out
what to do.

00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:59.195
And what we ran into was a
common problem that really

00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:02.220
any startup runs into but
was really pronounced by

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.534
our business model, which
was that for consumers, we

00:10:05.534 --> 00:10:09.690
had built a very robust, a
very comprehensive product.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.175
And for enterprises,

00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:14.940
we had actually built too
insignificant of a product.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.800
So, for consumers, what we
were running into was, we

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.030
had all these features that
you could pay for but a lot

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.070
of the consumers didn&#39;t need
all of those features.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.020
And for enterprises,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.500
we didn&#39;t really have
enough, security.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.310
And we didn&#39;t have enough
capabilities around how

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.220
enterprises wanted to use
their data.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.330
So we basically had more
functionality than what

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.080
a consumer wanted and less
than what enterprise wanted.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.420
And so we found ourselves at
this juncture.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.380
And we found ourselves
basically in this

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.090
period where it&#39;s very
difficult to figure out what

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.820
we wanted to go do with the
business, so

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.890
we had to make a choice,
right?

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.360
And so we were at this path
where basically,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.380
we&#39;re at a juncture where we
had to

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.090
choose which path do go
down.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:00.760
And this was back in early,
mid 2006, up to late 2006,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.970
so I was, I think, 23 at the
time.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.150
The co-founder was, was 22.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.625
Our founding team was even
younger.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.540
When we all dropped out of
college.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.365
And so back in 2006, 2007,
we imagined these two

00:11:14.365 --> 00:11:18.580
paths and the worlds were
very, very different.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.150
Like when you do a consumer
start up,

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.280
it&#39;s basically just lots of
fun.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.050
And, you know?

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.770
You have parties all the
time.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.902
And it&#39;s just super
exciting.

00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:29.330
And then the enterprise,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.900
you basically are battling
these just large incumbents.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.700
It&#39;s a fairly thankless, you
know?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.730
Model because you know?

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.330
People just generally hate
enterprise software.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.805
So that was sort of how we
imagined that the two

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:43.260
paths was, we had to choose,
you know,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.340
one of these two worlds.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.340
And so we looked at that and

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.170
we said okay, well consumer
looks really fun,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.450
enterprise looks really hard
and,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.900
and there&#39;s a lot of
competition.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.970
At the same time, in the
consumer space,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.440
you are always fighting this
issue of,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.410
how do you monetize?

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.160
How do you, how

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.760
do you actually get people
to pay for products?

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.570
And in the consumer space,
there&#39;s really only two sort

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.960
of business models that you
can do.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.250
You can have people pay for
your application.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.410
Or you can provide
advertising on

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.150
the application.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.820
And so just to give you a
little bit of perspective,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.000
these are today&#39;s numbers.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.936
Just to give you a little
bit of a sense of

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.285
the scale difference, in the
consumer world,

00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:21.225
there&#39;s about $35 billion
spent on

00:12:21.225 --> 00:12:23.902
mobile apps every year,
pretty big number, right?

00:12:23.902 --> 00:12:25.030
$35 billion that&#39;s,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.840
that&#39;s a lot of money being
spent on mobile apps today.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.750
For advertising, the global
digital advertising market

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.140
is $135 billion.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.230
So, you know, basically
combined

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.930
most consumer companies are
going after, if you&#39;re not

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:42.180
doing e-commerce, about $170
billion of

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.580
either sort of purchasing
power on applications or

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.340
global advertising around
these kinds of services.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.165
So, big numbers, lot of
opportunity there, however,

00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:57.232
in enterprise, there&#39;s
actually $3.7 trillion spent

00:12:57.232 --> 00:13:00.130
on enterprise IT every
single year.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.880
So these are the servers,
the infrastructure,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.250
the software, the
networking, the services.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.930
All of that stack of
technology equates to

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.160
a few trillion dollars spent
every single year.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.510
And so what we realized was,
okay,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.130
there&#39;s a pretty wide delta
between these two markets.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.640
We are gonna be fighting
over trying to

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.360
get consumers to pay a few
dollars a month.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.350
And Google and Microsoft and
Apple will probably try and

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.980
make this product be free
over time.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.310
And there were sort of
rumors that Google Drive was

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.710
coming out and these kind of
products that

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.540
eventually happened were
going to come out.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.160
But in the enterprise, it&#39;s
not so much about that they

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.820
are trying to always save
money on IT.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.090
They&#39;re actually trying to
increase productivity.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.820
They&#39;re trying to

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.680
get higher performance from
their businesses.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.605
So the value equation is
very different right?

00:13:45.605 --> 00:13:47.650
In consumer, we have a
limited amount of money that

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.030
we want to actually make
sure that we conserve for

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.210
as few things as possible
that we&#39;re gonna spend.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.190
In the enterprise,

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.410
it&#39;s a little bit of a
different shift,

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.950
where you&#39;re trying to think
about actually,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.750
what can I get out of
technology, and

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.890
how much value is that for
me.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.070
So, that was a really
important data point.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.860
However, the problem was
that enterprise software

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.170
was really, really unsexy.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.360
Right?
So again, very competitive,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.750
very difficult to build a
business.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.530
It wasn&#39;t something that
really you should have

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.190
shot out of bed in the
morning and said, okay, I&#39;m

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.810
super excited to build an
enterprise software company.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.510
And the reason for

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.600
that was actually pretty
straightforward at the time.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.665
The way that you built
software was very slow.

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:27.710
So you had to be very slow
because

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.730
you couldn&#39;t break anything
for customers.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.878
The sales process was very
slow because customers take

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:35.008
a long time to purchase
technology.

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:37.364
So I think everyone&#39;s sort
of used to this concept that

00:14:37.364 --> 00:14:39.617
usually when you try and
sell enterprise software to

00:14:39.617 --> 00:14:41.662
a company, it can take up to
a couple of years for

00:14:41.662 --> 00:14:43.424
them to actually just buy
the software.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.883
And then they can take a
couple more years for

00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:48.145
them to even implement the
technology in

00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:51.070
the first place, so a lot of
companies are around for

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.064
a few years without having
their technology even used

00:14:54.064 --> 00:14:55.216
in the enterprise.

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:57.087
That felt like a huge
problem.

00:14:57.087 --> 00:14:59.527
And not like something we
wanted to be a part of.

00:14:59.527 --> 00:15:02.268
The technology itself is
fairly complex.

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:04.514
So the user experience, I
don&#39;t know how many

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:07.107
people have had to use most
enterprise software, but

00:15:07.107 --> 00:15:09.920
it&#39;s generally really
complicated.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.010
You find yourself asking why
in God&#39;s name did

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:18.000
the designer try to put 47
buttons on the page.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.294
And you just can&#39;t even
understand it, and

00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:23.027
the reason is something
we&#39;ll get into in a second.

00:15:23.027 --> 00:15:25.195
But basically, there&#39;s just
no love or

00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:27.427
care for the design and user
experience,

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.870
the software&#39;s just really
complex.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.108
And then, finally, if that
wasn&#39;t bad enough,

00:15:32.108 --> 00:15:33.500
all of a sudden you had to

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.590
think about how do actually
sell the software.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.200
And, for anybody who loves
the power of the internet.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.460
This notion of having a
sorta sales intermediary, to

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.460
get to your customer, seemed
like, really unappealing.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.779
Like, you&#39;re gonna have to
go hire a bunch of people

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:49.110
that, that are gonna be
everywhere in the country.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.500
And they&#39;re gonna be the
only interface,

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.620
you have to your customer.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.259
You&#39;re gonna have to hire
these guys named Chuck.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.700
And Chuck&#39;s gonna roll in
with a briefcase, and

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.700
he&#39;s gonna just try and

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.620
sell, lots of enterprise
software to the customer.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.450
Just so we&#39;re clear, this is
what Chuck looks like.

00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:09.480
And that was the sales
process that you, in

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.585
the enterprise, that we at
least imagined in our heads.

00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:15.760
And I mean, Chuck looks like
a happy guy, but

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.970
he&#39;s still an intermediary
to getting your software.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.150
And we were saying, well,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.120
why can&#39;t we take the power
of the Internet and

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.760
actually, get our technology
out to people directly?

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.822
Why should we have to go
through this

00:16:27.822 --> 00:16:30.515
sales intermediary as we
scale the business?

00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:32.677
Now, I&#39;ll get into, in, in a
minute,

00:16:32.677 --> 00:16:35.159
why we were wrong about, the
sales process but

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:38.150
this was the sort of fear
that we had at the time.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.233
And then, if that wasn&#39;t
hard enough we

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:42.626
had investors in 2007 saying
basically,

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:46.560
there&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna
make it in the enterprise.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.250
You basically are again,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.290
a founding team of, of early
20 year olds.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.950
You don&#39;t have anybody on
your team that has been in

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.260
the enterprise.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.330
The Microsoft and Google and
all these things are, or

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.310
not Google, but Microsoft,
EMC, Oracle, IBM.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.190
These kinds of companies are
gonna stomp on you and

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.880
it&#39;s gonna be very, very
hard to actually achieve.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.460
And to be fair they were

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.940
right on a number of areas,
right?

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.952
So we were a very
inexperienced team.

00:17:08.952 --> 00:17:10.770
This is this was a,

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.160
in a stage where it is still
early in our careers.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.018
My co-founder, for

00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:15.910
instance, looked like he was
13 years old.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.656
So just not really, just to
be clear.

00:17:18.656 --> 00:17:19.610
This is what he looked like.

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.792
So So it, it sorta made
sense.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:23.670
Right?

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.531
This is, this is him as our
CFO at,

00:17:25.531 --> 00:17:27.036
I think this is him at 29.

00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:30.820
But it looked like we were
gonna go run

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.680
off with the money and go to
Disneyland.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.050
So I can totally appreciate
why they didn&#39;t think we

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.080
would be able to pull it
off.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.750
I can&#39;t imagine giving him
money.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.750
So basically, we decided
okay well we still have to

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.080
go do it, we have to just
give it our best shot.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.933
We&#39;re gonna take the sorta
scale,

00:17:50.933 --> 00:17:53.603
the consumer experience, the
DNA of our company.

00:17:53.603 --> 00:17:55.313
We&#39;re gonna see if we can
bring this,

00:17:55.313 --> 00:17:57.131
into the enterprise and then
we were very

00:17:57.131 --> 00:17:59.429
fortunate where actually we
had an investor who was

00:17:59.429 --> 00:18:01.580
equally early in his career
and made a bet on us.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.240
Because sorta with the
belief that there was

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.550
something fundamentally
changing about the

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.890
enterprise that we would be
able to take advantage of.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.757
And so, we decided that if
we&#39;re gonna do the

00:18:09.757 --> 00:18:12.350
enterprise, if we&#39;re gonna
go after the enterprise.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.140
That we would have to

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.955
play by a very different set
of rules.

00:18:14.955 --> 00:18:19.230
So, what about the
complexity of

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.430
software can change in this
new era?

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.600
What about the fact that the
sales process is very slow,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.590
can change in this new area,
era?

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.650
How do we move and go
directly to the user and

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.350
to the customer.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.500
As opposed to having this
very, sorta indirect process

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.030
of getting our technology
out there?

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.270
How do we build, in design
for that user as opposed to,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.700
just for the sale and sorta
for the RFP process that

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.820
a customer is going to go
through.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.010
And so we looked at all of
the factors,

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:47.080
that were true of the
enterprise.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.770
And we said, we&#39;re gonna do,
maybe not in all cases,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.620
the opposite, but we&#39;re
gonna find what is changed

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.010
about the technology world.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.280
Where we can take advantage
of that shift and build a,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.300
a better and a newer
enterprise software company.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.120
And so,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.880
that was the decision that
we embarked on.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.970
This is the path that we
embarked on

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.240
about eight years ago.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.990
And that is why, we&#39;ve been
focusing on the enterprise.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.970
And so today, again, we have
about 240,000 businesses

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.940
that use the product.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.140
And the reason is, we
architected the business

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.730
model, we architected the
software.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.475
We architected the solution,
to

00:19:19.475 --> 00:19:23.920
work in sorta one specific
version of the world.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.970
And it turned out that that
version ended up being,

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.320
the sort of, the one that
happened.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.020
And I&#39;ll go into a little
bit

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.597
about what has changed about
the world.

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:34.472
That we sorta built out
company around.

00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:36.260
And what, I would highly
recommend you,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.400
if your building an
enterprise software company,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.190
make sure to orient to your
technology and

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.850
solution around.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.090
So, that was, sort of, why
we made the decision,

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.260
and kind of how we started
to take on the problem.

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.130
Now I&#39;d talk, like to talk a
little bit about.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.140
What has changed about the
enterprise,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.830
that makes it sort of so
possible to enter it today,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.370
better and more seamlessly
than ever before.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.410
So, everything about the
enterprise and then

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.180
by definition the software
that an enterprise uses,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.420
has changed just in the past
five years.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.790
This is probably the most
magical time.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.230
If there could have ever
been a magical time to

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.060
build an enterprise software
company now is

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.920
absolutely that time.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.430
Just in terms of how much
change is going on

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.630
within organizations.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.160
So let&#39;s just go through a
couple of these things.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.520
So, the first is that most
application categories

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.660
are moving to the cloud.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.670
And the big difference is
this idea that if you were

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.410
going to start a customer
relationship management

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.800
software company, or

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.780
a business intelligence
software company.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.120
Or even a content management
company ten, 15 years

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.020
ago, you basically had to go
have your technology be

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.400
implemented, in every single
customer location.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.360
No matter how many customers
you sold to,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.790
no matter what regions
they&#39;re in, every single

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.600
customer had to put that in
their data center.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.440
And that was the flaw with
on-premise computing,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.510
was you were repeating all
of this work.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.540
You were, creating so much
redundancy.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.480
And it was, it was

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.740
then slowing down the entire
process of delivering and

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.560
building software for the
enterprise.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.850
And then all of the sudden
the cloud came around.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.830
Things like Salesforce.com,
things like

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.500
Amazon Web Services that
basically said.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.920
Why is it that, that every
customer,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.230
that wants to just implement
a couple servers,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.450
has to go procure the
servers.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.000
Put them in their data
center put all the security,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.770
all the networking around
those servers.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.270
And then, and

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.060
then, six months later they
go live and

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.490
then a developer can use
them in the organization, or

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.220
same thing with an
application.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.110
Amazon said why does that
make any sense today?

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.970
When we could just, put
together thousands,

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.200
tens of thousands, hundreds
of thousands of servers and

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.640
make them available on
demand.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.520
And you just use what you
want when you need that.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.280
And that was, that&#39;s
obviously a definition of

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.330
cloud computing.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.660
What is happening, though,
is finally CIOs in large

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.670
enterprises are taking
advantage of this.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.750
So it&#39;s, it seems obvious
for

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.130
everyone in this room
because you would

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.020
never build, a company by
buying your own servers.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.850
You would start it on
Amazon, or, or

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.720
Google or Azure or whatever.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.990
But to an enterprise,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.540
there are decades, literally
decades of investment in

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.950
infrastructure, that now has
to move to the cloud.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.610
And so that&#39;s obviously a
massive shift that is

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.060
finally happening.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.120
We are moving to a world of
cheaper, low cost, on demand

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.730
computing, from a world of
expensive computing.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.320
The benefit to building a
start up,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.800
is that customers don&#39;t have
the same kinda friction.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.250
When they&#39;re gonna go adopt
new technology, right?

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.910
As soon as the computing, is
so much cheaper,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.050
it becomes easier to adopt
new solutions.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.130
Which means, that their
barrier for

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.350
having a conversation.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.190
Their barrier for
introducing you then,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.710
into their enterprise, is a
lot lower,

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.840
which creates a massive
opportunity for start-ups.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.840
We&#39;re going from a world of
customized software,

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.860
to really standardized
platforms.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.720
So it used to be that you
had to

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.940
build custom integration&#39;s
and all of

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.580
the custom experiences on
top of the software itself.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.860
And now, customers are
realizing that actually they

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.530
want, open platforms and
they can customize at

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.380
the layer above the, the
product.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.000
It used to be that when you
were building enterprise

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.145
software company you could
only really sell to,

00:23:02.145 --> 00:23:05.230
the top five or 10,000
companies in the world.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.890
Because only those
companies,

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.120
had the where with all, the
talent,

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.740
the infrastructure and the
budget to deploy your

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.470
technology into the
enterprise.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.350
Today, literally a two
person company can sign up

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.870
for box, as well as we work
with General Electric which

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.830
has over 300,000 employees.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.860
So, the fact that you can
now serve a small

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:26.700
business anywhere in the
world.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.130
As well as some of the
largest companies on

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.480
the planet, mean that

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.070
there&#39;s much larger markets
that you can go after.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.970
Which makes it, obviously,
even a better economic

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.380
proposition to go after the
enterprise.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.450
The platforms themselves are
becoming more global.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:42.730
So our customers were
international literally

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.310
within the first couple of
weeks,

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.540
of starting the company.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.950
It would have been, usually
if you had done enterprise

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.320
software the traditional way
that would have taken years,

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.130
to actually be able to go
international.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:53.490
And then finally and

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.280
probably the most profound
shift of all.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.820
Is that because of mobile
devices, you know,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:02.170
iPhone&#39;s, iPad&#39;s, tablets
Android devices, the IT

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.340
model of the enterprise has
become a lot more user led.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.580
And, that&#39;s fundamentally
important because,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.260
in an IT led world,
incumbents generally win.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.480
Because, they have the
existing

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.680
relationship with the IT
organization, with the CIO,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.520
with the spending power
within that company.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.350
In a user led model, users
are bringing in,

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.700
their own technology.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.690
They&#39;re bringing it in on
the sales team,

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.060
they&#39;re bringing it in, in
the marketing team,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.000
they&#39;re bringing it in in
finance.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.330
And you can build software
then around the user.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.540
Which means that they can
bring the technology in.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.430
Then you can sell to the
enterprise when they

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.460
wanna have better control,

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.360
better security, better
scalability.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.893
So you still have the same
business model,

00:24:39.893 --> 00:24:41.650
as a traditional enterprise
software company.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.785
But the way to get into the
company is now,

00:24:43.785 --> 00:24:44.950
through the end user.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.160
Okay, so those are
qualitative factor changes.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.192
Just a couple quantitative
factor changes.

00:24:52.192 --> 00:24:52.882
There&#39;s over,

00:24:52.882 --> 00:24:55.192
nearly 2 billion smart
phones on the planet.

00:24:55.192 --> 00:25:00.010
That changes, every single
IT model, on the planet,

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.720
because it used to be, ten
years ago, if you

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.860
were managing technology for
an enterprise.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.590
You just had to manage the
computers and

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.560
the network that were inside
of your building.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.830
But now with billions of
mobile phones,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.920
you fundamentally have to be
able to

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.240
manage the network and the
computing.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.950
That is gonna be anywhere at
anytime on a network.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.925
And that creates massive
opportunity for

00:25:18.925 --> 00:25:19.998
software companies,

00:25:19.998 --> 00:25:22.880
because no incumbent has
built the technology stack.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.130
Sorry for my voice breaking
again,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.450
so no incumbent has built a
technology stack.

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.170
That powers this next
generation of work, and

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.830
how enterprises are using
their data.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.789
So that creates a massive
start up opportunity.

00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:38.490
There&#39;s nearly 3 billion
people online.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.230
What that means is that
every single enterprise is

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.310
equally changing how they&#39;re
gonna get their own products

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.700
to their customers.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.090
Which means, that every
industry changes.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.450
And so, there are really
only two times,

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.420
there are only two moments
of opportunity.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.510
Where a technology
revolution will happen in

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:56.160
the enterprise.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.410
The first is if the raw
materials change.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.430
So, cost of computing goes
down and then it&#39;s better to

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.710
centralize, and then let
people use it on demand.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.520
The second major change is
that the very customers that

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.580
these enterprises have to go
after, need new

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.180
experiences of working with
those enterprises&#39; products.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.330
Let me give you an example.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.430
If, you know, when you go
out off campus, you

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.860
probably use something like
Uber or Lyft, as an example.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.180
The if you were in the
transportation business.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.143
If you&#39;re in the shipping
business,

00:26:28.143 --> 00:26:30.200
if you&#39;re in the logistic
business,

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.420
Uber represents a massive
change to your industry.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.720
So you can&#39;t just let Uber
exist and

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.600
do its own thing without
understanding.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.920
What are the implications of
Uber?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.330
What are the implications of
InstaCart?

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.380
What are the implications of
Lyft to my business model?

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.800
And so, in a world where,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.470
enterprises are dealing with
that kind of change.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:50.260
They&#39;re gonna need new
technology,

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.980
to help them evolve their
business models, and

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.900
how they adapt to this
disruption.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.370
And so in every industry,
and

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.820
this is why it&#39;s an amazing
time to even build vertical

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.030
software companies for
industries.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.460
Right now, every single
industry is going through

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.270
a major business model and

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.810
technology oriented
disruption.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.080
Which means that they&#39;re
going to need

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.110
technology from startups to
help them work through this.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.200
I&#39;ll give you a couple of
examples.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.770
So, in the retail industry.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.882
There&#39;s this notion of sort
of omni-channel or

00:27:21.882 --> 00:27:23.450
multi-channel commerce.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.330
You&#39;re gonna shop online,

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.540
you&#39;re gonna shop on your
phone,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.390
you&#39;re gonna shop in a
store, and

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.500
you want things to be
delivered to you as well.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.410
So most of the incumbent
technology in the retail

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.690
industry, doesn&#39;t power
multi-channel commerce.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.540
No, nobody is prepared for

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.890
what does it mean when
consumers wanna go actually

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.450
buy goods at anytime from
anywhere.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.410
With better information and
better intelligence.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.100
So every retailer in the
world, is gonna need a new

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.760
technology stack to power
their retail experiences.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.100
In the health care space,
every single health care

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.160
institution is trying to
find ways of building a more

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.860
personalized experiences,
more predictive experiences.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.580
They wanna have medicine be
adapted to the individual.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.630
As the business model of

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.100
health care changes from
being about charging for

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.342
the surgery, charging for
the checkup.

00:28:13.342 --> 00:28:16.200
And instead where the
customer pays for

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.100
wellness and staying
healthy.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.600
Then all the sudden every
healthcare institution,

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.940
needs better technology to
deliver health care

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.840
experiences.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.668
They&#39;re gonna wanna deliver
telemedicine.

00:28:25.668 --> 00:28:27.800
They&#39;re gonna wanna deliver
healthcare in more

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.310
regional locations as
opposed to

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.150
just in the monolithic
hospital environment.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.050
There&#39;s going to be new use
cases around.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.550
How do our electronic health
records get connected to

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.610
one another so doctors can
make far better decisions.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.820
All of these things are
gonna require new enterprise

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.600
software to power these
businesses and

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.960
these industries.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.370
In the media space as an
example.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:51.070
You know, you have a world
where an industry is

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.820
going from really linear
programming.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.880
So whether that&#39;s
television, or

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.360
that&#39;s music, or whether
that&#39;s movies, there&#39;s sorta

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.140
very linear supply chain
oriented business model.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.280
Where a film gets made,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.320
it goes to the movie theater
for three months and

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.800
then afterwards it goes to
iTunes and

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.070
these other platforms.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.360
To a world where people want
experiences on demand.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.910
So that&#39;s gonna change,

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.850
how distribution works on
the scale of 3 billion

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.210
people that are on the
internet.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.850
And again, no media company
has a platform.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:19.750
That is gonna be able to
actually power,

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.480
how content and data and

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.430
information moves through
the system at scale.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.010
We were just,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.410
I was just in LA yesterday
meeting with a media

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.760
company that has basically
done predictive analytics.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.074
To find their potential
movie goers in

00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:38.132
the population of 3 billion
internet users.

00:29:38.132 --> 00:29:41.122
They wanna be hyper targeted
on how they get to the very,

00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:44.280
the sorta specific 30
million people that are fans

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.660
of different kinds of film
types.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.230
And so all of a sudden, you
have a movie company,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.872
that actually needs big
data.

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.686
And they need business
intelligence and

00:29:52.686 --> 00:29:54.241
they need marketing
automation.

00:29:54.241 --> 00:29:56.176
To go power how they&#39;re
gonna go market and

00:29:56.176 --> 00:29:57.372
distribute their movie.

00:29:57.372 --> 00:29:58.191
So again.

00:29:58.191 --> 00:30:00.270
Totally unpredictable
mash-up of two

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.042
industries coming together,
where all new kinds of

00:30:03.042 --> 00:30:05.050
software is gonna be
necessary.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.080
So, every industry is going
through some form of

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.060
this change.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.530
You can pick any industry
you want, and take and

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.230
sort of zoom into it and
say, what are the underlying

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.900
technology factors that are
gonna change the business

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.540
model of this industry in
the next couple of years?

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.960
And then there&#39;s gonna need
to be software that goes and

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.170
powers those experiences.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.880
Cool, are we all on the same
page, great.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.770
I just need a drink water,
so

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.058
if you could say something
that would be great.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.640
&gt;&gt; Can we also edit out my
water drinking, so

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.560
it doesn&#39;t make it look like
I

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.030
have some weird water
problem?

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.478
Okay, cool.

00:30:40.478 --> 00:30:42.740
I mean, think about the
future of water.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.620
Who&#39;s gonna power that,
right?

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.955
&gt;&gt; Gonna need, that&#39;s gonna
need software, I&#39;m sure, so.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.325
&gt;&gt; So basically, every
company in the world.

00:30:54.325 --> 00:30:57.345
We think of, you know, the
good fortune of being in

00:30:57.345 --> 00:31:00.084
Palo Alto, being at Stanford
is, is we&#39;re so

00:31:00.084 --> 00:31:02.080
hyper-focused on technology.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.480
And we think of the
technology industry as

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.470
an industry, but in reality
what is

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.410
happening is every company,
every industry is gonna have

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.840
a technology component of
what they do.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.643
You won&#39;t be able to survive
in the future,

00:31:14.643 --> 00:31:16.886
enterprises will not be able
to survive in the future,

00:31:16.886 --> 00:31:18.514
if they don&#39;t get good at
technology.

00:31:18.514 --> 00:31:20.300
If they don&#39;t have a
competency in

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.080
leveraging data and using
these new tools.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.780
But they&#39;re gonna do that
through working with

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.010
what we consider the
technology industry,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.250
as opposed to everybody
building up these pockets of

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.290
expertise themselves.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.540
So there&#39;s gonna be a lot of
partnership over the next

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.900
five to ten years, where
companies are gonna need to

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.910
use technology to work
smarter, to work faster.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:42.630
They&#39;re gonna need to do
this more securely, and

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.630
this is gonna change, not
only how individuals work in

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.310
these environments, but
ultimately change

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.118
the business models of these
companies.

00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:53.090
So that was chapter two of
this.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.410
That&#39;s all the things that
have been changed.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.534
Now some practical advice,

00:31:56.534 --> 00:31:59.370
where to kind of help you
get started.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.010
And to be fair, most of this
advice is

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.890
looking through the sort of
lens of retrospect, which

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.130
means that, that this is not
always how things happen.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.940
But I can look back in time
and say,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.090
these are things that led
certain things to be true.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.990
So it&#39;s hard to be super
deterministic about building

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.110
a company, and you might not
have all of these things

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.943
totally figured out.

00:32:22.943 --> 00:32:24.330
But these will give you a
sense of some of

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.270
the patterns to recognize
and

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.670
opportunities to exploit as
you&#39;re building, or

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.805
thinking about building, an
enterprise software company.

00:32:31.805 --> 00:32:35.890
So the first is, spot
technology disruptions.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:36.540
And this is gonna be

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.950
true whether you&#39;re building
consumer or enterprise.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.260
The rest are more enterprise
oriented, but

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.010
this is just fundamental to
entrepreneurship,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.610
if you&#39;re gonna build a tech
company.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.612
So you have to look for new
enabling technologies or

00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:52.337
major trends, like
fundamental trends, that

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:56.432
create a wide gap between
how things have been done,

00:32:56.432 --> 00:32:58.990
and how they can be done.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:02.670
And so, looking back in time
at our business, the gap was

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.260
basically, storage is
getting cheaper, internet

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.520
was getting faster, browsers
were getting better.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.840
Yet we&#39;re still sharing
files through this

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.990
very complicated, very
esoteric, very slow and

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.200
cumbersome means.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.000
So any time where the delta
between what is possible and

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.480
how things work today is at
its widest,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.550
that is an opportunity to go
build new technology to go

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.940
solve a problem.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.170
And so as you&#39;re looking at
the enterprise,

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.230
the question is, what about
the cost of computing

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.680
dropping so rapidly changes
what enterprises can

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.300
do with their data?

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.030
What does it change about
what you

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.390
can do from a business model
standpoint?

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.150
What was impossible, because
of either

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.660
economic feasibility or
technical feasibility 10 or

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.890
15 years ago, that now all
of a sudden is possible.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.440
And a fun thing you can do
sometime is,

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.140
if you go look at articles
from like the 1990&#39;s or

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.810
even the 1980&#39;s, business
articles about technology.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.580
All we&#39;re really doing is
repeating a lot of

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.300
the technologies that were
tried 10, 20, 30 years ago.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.200
It&#39;s just, it was too
expensive,

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.740
it was too unusable, and we
didn&#39;t have

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:13.460
the enabling technologies to
make it possible.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:16.280
So you can kind of see this
pattern emerge constantly

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.420
where something that was
impossible five or 10 years

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.030
ago, all of a sudden becomes
very practical.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.720
So I&#39;ll give you an example.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.790
There&#39;s a company called
PlanGrid.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.140
Does anybody know what
PlanGrid does?

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:26.660
Okay.
Cool.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.530
Are you in the construction
industry?

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.660
You are?

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.040
&gt;&gt; Oh, my god.
What does that even mean?

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.030
&gt;&gt; In terms of PlanGrid or
like in construction?

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.530
&gt;&gt; Construction.

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.140
&gt;&gt; I work at a job site.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.470
We build buildings.

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:40.107
&gt;&gt; Holy crap, that&#39;s great.

00:34:40.107 --> 00:34:41.641
&gt;&gt; Okay, so.

00:34:41.641 --> 00:34:42.938
Thank you.

00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:48.817
So basically PlanGrid is a
mobile application that

00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:53.610
lets you manage construction
projects.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.988
Lets you get access to your
blueprints, lets you manage

00:34:55.988 --> 00:34:58.320
all of the data around a
construction process.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:03.230
And what this team realized
was that $4 billion,

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.270
I believe, are spent every
year printing out blueprints

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.010
and making all of the
prints, and

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.896
updates to those blueprints
any time there&#39;s a change.

00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:11.190
And then that has to ripple
and

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.830
cascade through a very wide
network of contractors and

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.170
construction people every
time that

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.208
there&#39;s even just one
slight, minute change.

00:35:18.208 --> 00:35:20.646
And they realized that, you
know, with the iPad,

00:35:20.646 --> 00:35:23.138
all of a sudden, we have the
perfect form vector to be

00:35:23.138 --> 00:35:25.424
able to load up blueprints
and load up content.

00:35:25.424 --> 00:35:26.568
And this is something that

00:35:26.568 --> 00:35:28.804
could ripple through the
construction industry,

00:35:28.804 --> 00:35:30.936
which isn&#39;t necessarily
notoriously known for

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:33.510
high technology, except for
on the design side.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.980
How could they build
technology that would

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.580
make the data access, the
data collaboration problem

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.050
really, really seamless and
easy to do, in a very,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.330
you know, traditional
industry that

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.590
hasn&#39;t quite changed for a
while.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.800
So it was a sort of perfect,
sort of discovery of

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.280
a technology change in a
market and

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.780
figuring out how do those
two things converge.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.100
And then this team built a
great startup out of it that

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.830
is doing incredibly well,
and totally taking over

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.576
the construction industry as
proven by this individual.

00:36:04.576 --> 00:36:06.400
Thank you.

00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:11.230
&gt;&gt; So the next thing is, in
the enterprise you want to

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.880
start intentionally small.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.060
What I mean by that is, you
want to find, and

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.740
this is again, true of a lot
of companies, but

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.230
even more true in
enterprise,

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.150
in a user-led paradigm.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.640
You want to find the wedge
that is sort of the very

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.000
natural place where you can
create a product that will

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.420
slip in between the gaps of
other existing products.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.340
But is something that you

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.190
think over time expands to
become

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.140
a more important part of the
enterprise architecture.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.140
So, what you want to start
to do is to say,

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.510
we&#39;re gonna take this sliver
of a problem,

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.680
we&#39;re going to totally make
the user experience on

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.010
that incredible.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.990
We&#39;re gonna either change
the business model.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.360
We&#39;re gonna create new
technology that makes this

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.210
previously difficult problem
really, really simple.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.570
And it might feel small at
first.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.170
Maybe you&#39;re going after
small businesses and

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.620
then you&#39;re gonna move
upmarket.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.210
Maybe you&#39;re starting it
just a sliver of

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.170
the use case and then you&#39;re
gonna expand out.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.500
But you intentionally start
small because you

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.550
will not be able to compete
with an incumbent.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.190
Because the incumbent is
gonna always go for

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:11.320
the full solution.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.280
So you have to find what are
the gaps in

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.600
the full solution that are
significant enough

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.620
where a customer is going to

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:20.810
want to solve the problem
with a discreet technology.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.260
But that over time you&#39;re
gonna be able to expand,

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.435
again either to larger
customers or

00:37:25.435 --> 00:37:27.600
to more use cases over time.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.130
Great example is zenpayroll.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.119
So zenpayroll, started by a
Stanford graduate or

00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:35.580
Stanford graduates, couple
of years ago.

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:40.620
Basically discovered that
the payroll process in small

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.190
businesses is an incredibly
complicated and annoying and

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.370
cumbersome process.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.710
And that&#39;s because we use
the same vendors that we&#39;ve

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.470
been using for decades to do
that.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.630
And they weren&#39;t sort of
digitally oriented.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.750
You didn&#39;t get your payments
as a receipt, over email.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.880
It was a very complicated.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.970
You didn&#39;t really get to see
graphs of your salaries.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.040
There was no real good data
around this.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.530
And they said, we&#39;re just
gonna take

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.920
off the slice that is most
painful to startups around

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.820
hiring people and around
paying people,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.840
which is just that payroll
management process.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.160
We&#39;re going to plug into a
lot of

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.540
existing infrastructure, but

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.710
we&#39;re going to make it dead
simple to go do this.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.630
And now they&#39;re able to move
both up market over time

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.890
as well as deliver new
services over time.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.640
And what happens is the
incumbents in

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.110
this market initially look
at something like this and

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.810
payroll and they say, well,
that&#39;s small.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:30.980
It&#39;s only for small
businesses.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.450
It&#39;s not gonna be very
powerful.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:33.900
But that&#39;s just the start.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.540
Because as they get that
wedge and

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.020
as they fit into the market,

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.840
they&#39;re gonna be able to
expand again over time,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.410
build out more services and
more capabilities.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.330
But they found just the
exact right opening to build

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.149
a new company and have that
emerge.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.550
The next is you really want
to find asymmetries.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.710
You want to find, my God,
okay, so can we

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:58.660
do like some auto like some
tuning of a voice later so

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.490
at least it&#39;ll sound like
I&#39;m doing rap.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.001
{do things that incumbents
can&#39;t or

00:39:03.001 --> 00:39:04.692
won&#39;t do because it&#39;s
economically or technically

00:39:04.692 --> 00:39:06.417
infeasible} Okay, so you
want to be able to, you want

00:39:06.417 --> 00:39:08.460
to do things that incumbents
can&#39;t or won&#39;t do.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.280
Because, either the
economics don&#39;t make

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.170
sense for them.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.640
Or the economics are so
different, or

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.400
so unusual or because
technically they can&#39;t.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.850
I&#39;ll give you two examples.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:21.071
So, if you&#39;re gonna build
software today for

00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:24.788
the enterprise that goes
after an incumbent category

00:39:24.788 --> 00:39:27.854
that has more of a sweet
oriented approach.

00:39:27.854 --> 00:39:30.063
Then what you wanna go do,
is you wanna build

00:39:30.063 --> 00:39:32.960
technology that&#39;s gonna be
platform agnostic.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.210
Because what sweet players
will do, is they

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.460
want everything to be
integrated with itself and

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.330
that there&#39;s more value with
that vertical integration.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.550
But you wanna go after a
different access, which is,

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.480
you want your technology to
work across all of

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.670
the platforms.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.610
So that way, you can work
with so

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.330
many different kinds of
customers, and

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:52.810
you can be an ally to so

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.370
many different kinds of
platforms,

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.250
which a traditional
incumbent is not able to do.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:57.460
So that&#39;s something that is

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.810
usually technically
infeasible, because of

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:02.550
how either something has
been architected.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.430
Or because the fundamental
component of

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.030
the business model to not do
that as the incumbent.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.800
But, the other thing is try
and

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.230
do things that are
economically infeasible.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.620
You can look at the cost
structure of

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.630
an incumbent company and
discover where are they

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.010
not going to be able to drop
their prices.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.370
Because that business model
is fundamental to

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.300
the existence of the
company.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.180
Or where can you find ways
of monetizing the customer

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.802
that are unusual or

00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:33.312
unique, that no one has
discovered before.

00:40:33.312 --> 00:40:35.500
And thus is really not
practical for

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.800
anyone else to do.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.110
That&#39;s a company called
Zenefits, where they have

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:43.010
an HR management software
company that helps you,

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.220
as a small startup,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.940
manage all of your benefits,
all of your HR information.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.830
And instead of charging the
startup, which might not

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:52.530
value that software at the
stage that they&#39;re at.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.820
They realized that they
could get

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:56.690
commission from the
insurance companies.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.710
And that basically pays for

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.450
the ability to use their
software.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.030
So, the customer itself is
not paying for

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.900
Zenefits, the Zenefits
platform is being paid for

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.815
by the insurance company.

00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:08.874
And they&#39;ve thus invented a
business model,

00:41:08.874 --> 00:41:10.932
that no other software
company has been able to

00:41:10.932 --> 00:41:11.848
think of or attack.

00:41:11.848 --> 00:41:13.653
And they&#39;re equally going
and

00:41:13.653 --> 00:41:16.431
disrupting a category that
hasn&#39;t seen a lot of

00:41:16.431 --> 00:41:19.279
innovation previously, which
is the health and

00:41:19.279 --> 00:41:22.137
benefit space within small
businesses.

00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:25.504
The next is you wanna find
the really crazy but, but

00:41:25.504 --> 00:41:28.873
sort of still somewhat
reasonable outliers within

00:41:28.873 --> 00:41:31.070
the customer ecosystem.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:34.180
So you need to find the
customers that are sort of

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.730
at the edge of their
business, or

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.690
at their business model, or
of their industry.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:39.770
And find the unique
characteristics about those

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.020
customers, and leverage them
as your early adopters.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.810
So Paul Graham has a great
article, where he

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:49.000
talks about living in the
future and building for

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.460
what is missing when you&#39;re
living in the future.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.050
So that&#39;s a sort of easy way
to spot trends and

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:56.750
patterns about disruption
that&#39;s playing out.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:58.920
The same is true in the work
place.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.990
If you find customers that
are working in the future,

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.040
you will be able to work
with them to find what is

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.480
missing when you&#39;re working
in the future.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.310
And how we build technology
that supports all these new

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.410
use cases that are going to
emerge.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.170
There&#39;s a company called
Skycatch,

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.710
which does enterprise
drones.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.500
And at first it seems kind
of weird, but

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.260
in the construction space,
in farming, in oil and

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.990
gas, they&#39;re using drones
now for data capture, and

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.910
the ability to do modeling
of,

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.300
of different environments.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.147
And so, this company is able
to find all of the companies

00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:34.873
that are at the bleeding
edge of their industry, what

00:42:34.873 --> 00:42:37.797
is unique or new about how
those organizations operate.

00:42:37.797 --> 00:42:40.721
And they built and worked
with a lot of those early

00:42:40.721 --> 00:42:44.144
adopters to establish their
platform, which is again,

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:47.370
really one of the first
enterprise drone companies.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:50.050
So the idea is go look at
your market.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.684
Find the customers that are
at the bleeding edge of

00:42:52.684 --> 00:42:55.317
the market, who use
technology to get ahead, and

00:42:55.317 --> 00:42:58.027
that use technology for
performance advantages.

00:42:58.027 --> 00:43:01.153
And then go work with them
to discover how your product

00:43:01.153 --> 00:43:02.220
can evolve.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.280
Two minutes.

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:04.880
Okay.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.769
Good.
Right, so.

00:43:07.675 --> 00:43:08.207
The next one is.
And

00:43:08.207 --> 00:43:10.867
then there&#39;s a part two in
five minutes from now, or

00:43:10.867 --> 00:43:12.360
is that not the case?

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.540
Okay, so, listen to your
customers, but

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.720
don&#39;t always build exactly
what they&#39;re telling you.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.590
This is a really key

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.390
distinction around building
enterprise software.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.700
Your customers are gonna
have a large number of

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.510
requests.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.520
Your job is to distill those
requests down

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.940
into the ultimate product.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.430
That does not mean that
you&#39;re going to

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:32.500
build exactly what they tell
you to build.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.150
It is your job to listen to
their problems, but

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.190
actually translate those
into what is going to build

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.360
the best and simplest
solution to those problems.

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.570
It&#39;s really your job, and
Palantir does this,

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:47.180
as an example, with very,
very complex issues.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.410
And then they distill those
down into simple solutions

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:51.430
for very, very,

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.120
complex problems that the
customer otherwise would not

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.830
have known how to ask for

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.530
You want to modularize, not
customize.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.459
So build a platform, as
opposed to building all of

00:44:01.459 --> 00:44:04.742
the custom technology and
custom vertical experiences

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:07.188
directly in the software
itself.

00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:09.080
Make sure that you really
think about openness in

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.120
APIs as a way of delivering
vertical or

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.320
custom experiences.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.500
Don&#39;t build that directly
into the product.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.420
Focus on the user always.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.616
So, again, the magical thing

00:44:18.616 --> 00:44:21.388
about building an enterprise
software company right now.

00:44:21.388 --> 00:44:23.790
Is you can keep consumer DNA
at the center of

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.010
the product.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.512
That will always mean that
adoption is easier.

00:44:27.512 --> 00:44:29.160
Your product has a much
higher chance of

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.200
going viral.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.590
It becomes easier to sell
into the organization.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.600
So always make sure you
bring consumer DNA

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.550
into the product development
process.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:39.373
And your product should sell
itself, but

00:44:39.373 --> 00:44:41.980
that does not mean you don&#39;t
need sales people.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.950
So this is a really
important distinction.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.050
Leverage everything about
the internet, leverage

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.210
everything about users to
get to your customers.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.120
But you still will likely
need sales as a way to

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.400
help your customers navigate
your product.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.730
Help your customers navigate

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.400
the competitive landscape
and the ecosystem.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.464
So you&#39;re going to want
consultative, very,

00:45:01.464 --> 00:45:04.376
very domain-oriented sales
individuals,

00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:07.669
that are gonna be able to be
helpful in your customer

00:45:07.669 --> 00:45:11.136
being deployed and enabled
in these organizations.

00:45:11.136 --> 00:45:13.380
But don&#39;t make that be a
substitute.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.924
Do not make that be a
handicap for

00:45:15.924 --> 00:45:18.380
not building a great
product.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.200
So you fundamentally have to

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.710
keep the product at the
center of that.

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:22.420
Company called Mixed Panel
comes in through

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.670
the developer, and then over
time is able to sell to that

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.700
organization with a more
inside sales-led process.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.425
Also read these three books.

00:45:29.425 --> 00:45:32.930
So Crossing the Chasm,
Innovators Dilemma, and

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.970
Behind the Cloud.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.220
These three combined,
especially if you read,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.510
if you binge and you just
read them all.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:39.260
You&#39;ll definitely come out

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.370
the other end with a massive
software company.

00:45:42.714 --> 00:45:45.802
And so, in closing today.

00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:48.850
Right now,when you leave
this room, is an amazing

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.730
time to go start an
enterprise software company.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.340
So I wish you the best of
luck.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.490
And of course, if it doesn&#39;t
work, we are hiring.

00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.540
So, and then the only other
caveat is please do

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.630
not compete with me.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.560
Because I have a lot of
competition already.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.280
So ideally either come work
for us, or

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.540
build your own company.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.510
So thank you very much.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.520
Very exciting, and thank you,
Sam for having me.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.790
Sam and I have known each
other for, for

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.530
a long time because we were
fellow Sequoia companies and

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.800
we met in the early days of
when he was on his

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.530
company journey and so it&#39;s
cool.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.560
So what he asked me to talk
about today, was a little bit

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.740
about sort of the hardware
journey of building products.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.460
So what I want to do is give
you guys a little bit of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.130
an overview of Jawbone.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.700
What we do how we think about
the world, and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.520
that informs how we build
products and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.770
goes specifically into in the
process of how we design,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.125
how we develop, and how that
all kind of comes together.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:33.490
And sort of what we do to
change categories.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.410
So first off, I always like to
start with, with sort of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.870
the broadest thinking and, and
the way we look at the world.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.890
As we think of ourselves at
this intersection of,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.740
of really crafted innovation
in engineering that&#39;s

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.540
almost invisible to the user,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.260
in terms of it&#39;s functionality
and

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.430
that&#39;s at the intersection of
even beyond design we&#39;ve been

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.330
doing design products for you
know well over a decade now.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.390
We think of it as going, the
conversation has

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.190
shifted even beyond design
into beauty.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.720
And it&#39;s that intersection of
engineering meets beauty,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.590
and the whole point is to help
people with a better life

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.380
with technology.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.680
And largely speaking, we, we
do play in this world of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890
what everyone&#39;s talking about
now is Internet of Things.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.180
We were there much longer
before there was such a,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.290
a moniker.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.250
And the way we think about
that is it&#39;s smart

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.640
devices that have computing
power and connectivity with

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.530
sensors in them that are
measuring all kinds of things.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.710
They&#39;re wirelessly connected
and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.570
they&#39;re all talking to you,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.160
and we started on this journey
really, really early, right,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.650
actually out of engineering
school here.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.250
And we were developing core
technology,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.630
we decided to build consumer
products around that.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.570
Our first consumer product was
the headset.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.650
We, we sort of created a
headset that

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.790
become a wearable computer.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.770
It was the first Jawbone
headset.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.280
That was when we

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.560
started thinking about
wearable computing.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.640
We then invented the wireless
speaker space around Bluetooth

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.900
audio and I&#39;ll talk a little
bit about that journey.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.620
And then most recently, we
focused our attention on

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.910
through this whole wearable
health revolution and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.200
using a lot of the sensors
that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.540
we did in the first generation
of headsets and applying them

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.570
to other parts of the body to
understand more about users.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.900
So our view of, of this world,
having been here for

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.860
a long time, is that it&#39;s a
little bit of a mess

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.710
in the internet of things.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.810
Everything in the world is
smart and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.100
connected, and everything has
an app built to it.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.880
That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s
easy for users, right?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.230
Your microwave, your
refrigerator, your car,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.300
your XBox, your Xfinity,
Comcast,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.220
everything has an app.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.330
It doesn&#39;t talk to each other.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.140
It&#39;s really confusing for the
user.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.730
So we think that there&#39;s a
desperate need for

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.700
an organizing principle around
all of this.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.140
And this is sort of the core
of

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.830
when we start to think about
how we build and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.740
opportunities to sort of
create products,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.050
we think about where is the
world going?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.020
And so, if there is going to
be such a world that,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.720
that everyone&#39;s talking about
around The Internet Of Things

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900
which is happening, you do
desperately need

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.520
these organizing principles so
that it&#39;s easier for users to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.100
understand how to come in and
interact with these services.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.320
So we think the thinking needs
to shift from being less about

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.060
the actual things to being
about the individual user.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.780
And so ultimately, when
everyone&#39;s talking about

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.940
wearables and you have things
like Google Glass and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.980
you have the stuff that we do
and, you know, Apple Watch and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.540
all this stuff, ultimately
what we believe is that

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.002
when you have things on your
body 24/7,

00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:17.250
they become this kind of
perfect context engine for

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.240
everything in the world around
you, right?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.550
So my phone is not on me,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.990
it&#39;s in my jacket or sometimes
on the charger.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.890
But my Up is on me, and it,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.680
it understands everything
that&#39;s happening with me.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.510
It&#39;s tracking my heart rate.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.990
It&#39;s tracking my respiration.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.490
It&#39;s tracking all these
different things.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.500
And when I, when I say context
engine, I know I can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.870
tell the smart thermostat in
my nest that I&#39;m hot or cold.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.980
That device doesn&#39;t have that
understanding.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.770
I can tell it&#39;s hot, that
device I&#39;m hot because I&#39;m

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.500
sick, went for a run, it&#39;s hot
outside.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.780
I can tell your car that
you&#39;re falling asleep,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.648
that you&#39;re agitated or
irritated.

00:03:47.648 --> 00:03:50.290
So this is ultimately where we
think the world is moving,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.880
is that wearables are going to
be the center of this,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.840
this revolution around
everything being connected and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.560
smart and they&#39;re going to
drive what a lot of those

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.170
interactions are going to be
and how they&#39;re going to work.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.040
Right?
And so, that&#39;s sort of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.940
the first principle that we
think about when we

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.170
start to think about okay,
where are things going, and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.840
what we should, should we
build, and,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.220
and how do we think about new
categories, right?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.260
So in order for

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.090
the vision of what we&#39;re
talking about to happen,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.410
you actually need to be great
at almost everything.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.460
We need to be great at what we
call the full stack.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.620
We have to be amazing at
building hardware, and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.890
these are hardware experiences
that people have to

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.220
keep on all the time.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.880
Right, you have to wear them
24/7,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.760
because if you don&#39;t, then
everything that I&#39;m

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.848
talking about is sort of a
castle in the air, right.

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:32.770
You can&#39;t actually create a
service that people will

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.830
engage with, or

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.530
get lots of data off it to
then go power all these other

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.280
things, if it doesn&#39;t start
with great hardware.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.680
So that&#39;s where we start.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.070
We try to build, you know,
these magical experiences in

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.210
hardware that absolutely
powered by software.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.220
We have developed world class
software

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.030
application expertise.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.250
We&#39;ve gotta be as good there
from an engagement

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.030
perspective as something like
an Instagram or Whatsapp.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.020
And then on the data side
we&#39;ve gotta know what to do

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.480
with this, this massive amount
of information, and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.730
process it and push it, and
have it work for the user.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.770
So we really see ourselves as
being at the intersection, for

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.940
the first time, of a company
that&#39;s doing hardware,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.633
software, and data, as three
kind of equal stools that have

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:15.260
to work together in order to
unlock that experience around

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.480
somethings that&#39;s on you,
knowing what&#39;s happening.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.460
And then talking to the rest
of the world around you.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.820
So that&#39;s a pretty key piece
of what we do.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.500
I think it&#39;s different than
what a lot of

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.460
other companies do.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.080
And it allows us and

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.720
requires us to play at all
levels of stack.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.930
Now this was a complicated
thing for us to put together.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.430
Because typically, you know,
people who are great at

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.850
hardware understand mechanical
engineering,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.024
electrical engineering, how
those things interact,

00:05:38.024 --> 00:05:41.920
wow you build at scale, how
you build tools, etc.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.290
They&#39;re not typically great at
building software and

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.070
services, right.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.390
It&#39;s a very different
discipline and

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.340
a very different skill set.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.760
So when we first put those
pieces together, that created

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.510
a lot of interesting friction
in the company.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.780
Our software and application
team was so

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.110
used to moving really, really
fast and iterating.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.240
Whereas in the hardware world,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.540
you gotta take your time
because your iteration cycles

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.450
are much more deliberate.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.840
You have tooling that takes 16
weeks.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.310
You can&#39;t just tweak stuff,
and

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.130
you can&#39;t hack it in the same
way.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.180
And so what was interesting to
see is we put all these

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.070
pieces together, the hardware
team learning to move faster,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.100
the software guys thinking
more about how do they

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.330
resolve experiences before you
actually have to ship it

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.246
versus just throwing something
out and AB testing it and

00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:26.610
then the data science sort of
informs all of that with sort

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.020
of more information to make
different kinds of decisions.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.340
So how do we think about, how
do we go,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.920
how do we build products, how
do we change categories?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.470
First of all, everything for
us is a system.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.040
Right, we don&#39;t think about it
discreetly just as a piece of

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.270
hardware, discreetly as an
application or

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.320
discretely as a, as a
platform.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.260
We think about it across the
whole thing, and

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.910
so this is an example with Up,
right, where we

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.380
have these tracking sensors on
the body, algorithms there.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.310
It connects to the phone where
you have this

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.180
engaging application service
experience.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.030
We use the sensors in the
phone.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.980
That talks to a lot of stuff
that we&#39;re doing in the cloud,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.710
where we&#39;re taking all that
information,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.730
driving insight on it and

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.910
then we have a huge platform
of thousands of developers

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.350
where they have thousands of
apps that then plug in and

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.970
also create more experiences.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.600
And so we think about it
across the whole spectrum and

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.130
I&#39;ll, I&#39;ll come back to this
system think in a,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.180
in a second.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.440
So what is the actual process
of, of creation look like?

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.320
And this is fun for

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.180
me cause we don&#39;t actually
talk about this very often.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.280
It&#39;s quite you know sort of,
we keep in confidential and

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.890
private and I know that we are
talking, now that we,

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.870
we&#39;re on sort of a live cast
everywhere.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.545
So it&#39;s fun for me to talk
about this for the first time,

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:33.170
because it&#39;s not or

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.940
it&#39;s, it&#39;s quite a deliberate
process, right.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.740
And this is a little bit at
what it looks like.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.650
And, and this is kind of a map
where we are very unbridled in

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.660
our imagination in the
exploration phase.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.110
We start to validate some of
our concepts,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.830
bring those ideas tighter and
tighter and tighter and

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.330
then we actually start to
build a product, launch it and

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.330
then iterate, right?

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.530
That&#39;s the simplest way to
look at.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.550
I&#39;ll take you through each of
these steps.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.720
So in the exploration phase,
it is very wild.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.580
It&#39;s imaginative.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.920
We think about the vision of
where the world&#39;s going,

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.760
what our strategy is, what
does the brand stand for.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.880
And we think of it a lot of,
of what you guys do here.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.280
You&#39;re dreaming, you&#39;re
imagining it,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.320
how do you disrupt, what&#39;s the
future going to look like?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.050
Right?
It is a little bit science

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.600
projecty sometimes, and we
talk about it in that way,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.850
right, and we do build from
inspiration and insight.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.410
And that&#39;s, it&#39;s sort of raw
creativity.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.200
And we want to create, and we
try to create,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.410
a form where that&#39;s okay.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.400
because a lot of times in
companies, that gets lost.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.430
And then, when we sort of
bring it to early validation,

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.520
where I always say, like,
look,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.140
everyone, when you&#39;re doing
this stuff,

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.370
you have to now take those
concepts and

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.710
prove them a little bit like
you do a PhD thesis, right?

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.080
Where you have your
conclusions, you&#39;ve done your,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.430
you know, empirical data
collection,

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.250
and you start to say hey look,
here&#39;s where we see it going.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.700
Here&#39;s what it&#39;s going to do,
right?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.750
And you outline the story.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.860
And then once we&#39;ve sort of
signed it off on

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.630
that phase that we think okay,
you know what,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.550
there, there, this theory&#39;s
right.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.890
We start to go into a
concepting phase where we

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.500
start to really think about
what is the experience and

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.430
what&#39;s possible.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.160
And this is a, this is another
interesting opportunity for

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.010
innovation at a more specific
level of how this thing

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.750
will come to life, or what it
is, and how would we sell that

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.860
experience, and how would we
tell that story.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.380
And then it, and then we
decide that it&#39;s a program.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.950
And it goes into a heavy
planning phase,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.770
where we start to look at and
say, okay.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.342
We&#39;re doing this.

00:09:18.342 --> 00:09:19.980
We&#39;ve gotta ship it.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.310
There is no turning back
right?

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.030
What are the trade-offs
between all the creativity and

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.910
all the ideas we want versus
what does the physics dictate?

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.020
What are the you know battery
power or

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.170
all the different constraints
that we have and

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.640
start making those trade-offs
and start to look at,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.650
you know, how do we pull that
together?

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.460
And then we move into a
development phase where it&#39;s

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.800
a hand off between various
stages.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.730
and, and really various
functional teams in

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.770
the company and you pull it
together and

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.470
you&#39;re solving problems as you
go implement this.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.370
And you launch it and you
learn.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.470
And you see what users think.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.540
And then you start to think
about where does this stand in

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.250
that experience continuum that
you&#39;ve been imagining where

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.520
the world&#39;s going to go.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.860
What have we achieved, what
haven&#39;t?

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.790
What have we learned from our
users?

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.630
How does that change what
we&#39;re thinking?

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.030
And then we start right over
again, right?

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.870
So that&#39;s the broadest way to
think about it.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.470
A little bit deeper on the
exploration phase, right?

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.860
So it is very much like a
building and

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.670
tinkering process, right.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.269
And, and a lot of it is driven
by what we call demo Fridays,

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.287
where people kind of have an
opportunity to go

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:21.312
showcase their work.

00:10:21.312 --> 00:10:24.286
because we find that that&#39;s a
great way to pull it together,

00:10:24.286 --> 00:10:26.816
pull it in a form that others
can consume it, and

00:10:26.816 --> 00:10:28.166
give feedback, right.

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:31.267
And it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a, it&#39;s a
really, it is a show and tell.

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.278
Obviously hack-a-thons are a
big part of it,

00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:35.310
there&#39;s lots of data that,
that gets driven.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.550
And it&#39;s lead by our, our
strategic developments,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.857
in which is traditionally
called sort of an R&amp;D team.

00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:42.225
And there&#39;s participation from
product and

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.846
engineering both hardware and

00:10:43.846 --> 00:10:46.773
software but they&#39;re sort of
taking a back seat and

00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:50.160
they&#39;re looking at what these
explorations are, right?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.390
And, the executives in

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.770
the company at this phase are
more of a sounding board.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.510
They&#39;re there to poke and prod
and

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.644
tell people, hey think about
this, or did you thought,

00:10:57.644 --> 00:11:00.520
did you try that, how does
that work, right.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.170
So, in, in this phase,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.360
in order to move to the next
threshold we think about it

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.515
literally as, hey would I give
this guy 50 grand?

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:08.780
It&#39;s a little bit like an
angel investment, right?

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.280
Would I give this guy 50 grand
to go explore this and

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.240
see if there&#39;s a there there,
is there something to do.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.110
And our CTO is the, is the
sort of final decision maker.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.650
He gets to sort of pick those
things internally and

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.810
say, you know what I, I like
all the feedback.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.460
This is the one I want to go
chase down and

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.480
see what happens, right?

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.640
So then we get into this
validation phase, and

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.660
this is where it starts to get
really interesting.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.020
Still led by R&amp;D, but they&#39;re
really poking at it and

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.390
they&#39;re saying, how does this
work?

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.810
We have these leadership
meetings with

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.050
the broader cross-functional
team.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.360
I have to show results.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.650
I have to go through a
scientific process to outline,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.500
you know, why this works.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.200
Why, why is it going to
happen.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.000
And, and you&#39;ll hear.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.220
This is really when we start
formulating a really

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.020
important tool that we use in
the company,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.280
which is what we call, why&#39;s.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.610
Defining the, why are we doing
this?

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.700
Why does this exist?

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.780
What problem does it solve?

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.930
I&#39;m going to come back to
that, in deeper in,

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.770
in a minute, right?

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.440
And so at this point, it&#39;s
still an R&amp;D lead.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.860
But this is when a lot of our
industrial design team,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.500
you have Bahar, and, and a few
project guys.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.040
They come in, they start to
think about, okay,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.220
how can I pull this concept
into something physical that&#39;s

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.930
hardware, and how is that
going to interact with

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.700
the rest of the pieces of the
system?

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.208
Our product experience team is
still also driving a lot of

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:20.570
the core values and, and what
the storyboarding is.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.270
But it starts to become a lot
more real, and this is when we

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.930
start thinking about, okay,
how would we build this?

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.320
You know, how expensive is
going to be,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.317
what&#39;s the budget going to be,
etc, right?

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.310
And at that point, right,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.560
we start to really validate,
can we actually build it?

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.860
Or do we have to wait three
years for

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.290
batteries to be there or, or
do we have to wait for

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.430
this other innovation to
happen, or do we have to wait

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.260
from a budget perspective, or
whatever it is.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.170
Is there a business viability,
and

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.510
then we start to, really start
to sketch kind of briefs.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.040
And this is where I come in,
and, and

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.970
make the final decision on,

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.370
okay, I think this is the,
there&#39;s really a there there.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.020
We can now take this to the
next level and

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.220
get it into, into a play.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.820
And then we go into the
concept phase, right?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.040
And this is now when the, the
responsibility shifts from

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.310
the R&amp;D folks to what we call
product experience team.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.403
And the way we think about
product experience in

00:13:10.403 --> 00:13:11.186
Jawbone is sort of

00:13:11.186 --> 00:13:13.813
what everyone thinks of this
sort of conventional design.

00:13:13.813 --> 00:13:15.952
So from industrial design to,

00:13:15.952 --> 00:13:19.243
you know, software design to
audio design to,

00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:23.340
you know, anything in that
touches that experience.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.740
We have writers on that team,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.990
story tellers, we have, you
know,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.960
ID people like Eve who are you
know, genius creatives.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.490
We have amazing, you know,

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.110
app level designers, graphic
designers, everything.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.343
It&#39;s all in one team, and we
call that product experience.

00:13:35.343 --> 00:13:38.718
And their job is sort of from
bits to atoms and back and

00:13:38.718 --> 00:13:43.006
all the way through to unify
as, as one organization.

00:13:43.006 --> 00:13:45.383
And that&#39;s when they sort of
take a hold of this, and

00:13:45.383 --> 00:13:48.031
they start to really kind of
work out what is, what is, and

00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:49.003
this is what we call,

00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:51.740
when you&#39;re starting to really
drive the why&#39;s, right?

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.231
Thinking about what&#39;s
possible, there&#39;s a lot of

00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:57.122
innovation and creativity now
in the actual implementation

00:13:57.122 --> 00:13:59.740
of how we&#39;re going to build
and create a product.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.470
And we start to say like,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.460
what are the most important
things in that product?

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.350
That, what are the most

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.640
important problems we&#39;re going
to solve?

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.090
We call them hero experiences,
right?

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.920
What are we going to to do.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.323
How, what is the bar that,

00:14:09.323 --> 00:14:12.314
that will be acceptable, etc,
right.

00:14:12.314 --> 00:14:15.086
And at this point we start to
really resolve what we call

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:18.115
these why&#39;s, which I&#39;ll show
you again in a minute.

00:14:18.115 --> 00:14:21.430
And why is that different from
what anyone else has done.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.740
From the competition from the
category.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.535
And then what is, where does
it go, right.

00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:27.560
It&#39;s we don&#39;t like to do just
one off things,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.340
we have to see a broader
vision.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.730
And this is part of that, that
creation experience,

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.160
is we look at, at where do we
think the world is moving,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.870
and how is this thing going to
be a stepping-stone to

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.660
that ultimate end vision.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.450
And that&#39;s where the road map
starts to get fleshed out,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.630
get, I have the ability here
to come in and

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.490
sort of be the final decision
maker with my team and

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.930
say, yep, we&#39;re going to move
this to this next phase.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.910
And here is also where we look
at some of these things.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.780
and, and when I get into some
of

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.610
the specific examples we have
fast track programs, right.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.980
So we took, for example,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.580
the Jambox when we were in
this phase and

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.370
we we said, we&#39;re not going to
go through that phase, we&#39;re

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.630
going to go straight into the
development process, right.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.070
Because we want to get this
thing out,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.290
we want to test it and market
it, and move really quickly.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:07.920
So we have the ability to sort
of

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.560
circumvent our own process now
and say like, okay let&#39;s go,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.630
let&#39;s go really rapid and fast
track it, and recalibrate,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.020
kind of, the go to market
possibilities, right?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.780
So this is when we, after this
stage now,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.000
it shifts from that product
experience team to our product

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.240
managers, who are really
defining the business plan.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.220
When&#39;s it going to launch?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.230
When&#39;s it going to get into
the retail calendar?

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.882
When do, what is the, you
know, software release cycle.

00:15:30.882 --> 00:15:34.100
Really prototyping actually
starting to feel it and you&#39;re

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.280
starting to make as I call a
lot of those trade offs.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.260
Where like, okay we wanted to
build this, we can&#39;t do that,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.370
but here&#39;s what we can do.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.430
We want to be this way we have
to,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.350
you know, we want these
functional experiences, but

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.350
we&#39;re going to sacrifice
battery life.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.670
Whatever it is, that&#39;s where
we start to really

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.470
kind of pool those decisions
and start looking at it.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.411
And, and it&#39;s really a big
juggling act frankly at that,

00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.470
at that point right.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.260
And so the, the product guys
are, are driving that.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.580
And that&#39;s when again you know
we, we sort of look at and

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.580
synthesize all of what we&#39;ve
put together and we say okay,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.980
does it actually cross enough
things off our list.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.270
Does it meet that, that
minimum viability, right?

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.406
because we, we alway start
with a very, as you can tell,

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:15.495
like this very big wish list
of what&#39;s possible and

00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:16.143
what we can do.

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:18.148
And then we start to whittle
it down and

00:16:18.148 --> 00:16:21.092
say, is this cross enough of
the value threshold that we

00:16:21.092 --> 00:16:24.075
think that it&#39;s, it&#39;s worth
pursuing.

00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:27.600
And now can we actually move
it into the development phase

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.480
where again product management
continues to lead it,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.320
but now you&#39;re starting to
really get deep.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.960
And this is where engineering
comes in and

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.670
is really starting to sign off
on like we can build it,

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.020
here&#39;s a time schedule and how
we ship.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.950
And then again, you know,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.970
product team is looking at how
should we go deeper on this,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.840
how can we increase engagement
with a little innovations.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.790
Or the tuning, what are all
the things that we need to do

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.106
to sort of make that?

00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.833
You know one of the things
that we&#39;ve been fortunate to

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:54.543
have is a lot of

00:16:54.543 --> 00:16:57.349
wonderful response to the
products that we&#39;ve built.

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:59.962
And, and, and we take a lot of
care and time and

00:16:59.962 --> 00:17:02.776
detail really in, in sort of
this development and

00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:06.059
concepting phase around little
details that create these

00:17:06.059 --> 00:17:07.410
magical experiences.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.838
So for example when we turn on
Jambox, you know,

00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:13.037
we have this pretty cool sound
design that go and you know,

00:17:13.037 --> 00:17:13.984
that, that took,

00:17:13.984 --> 00:17:16.853
you know, months to come up
with the right audio tuning.

00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:18.628
We worked with a lot of
different, you know,

00:17:18.628 --> 00:17:20.406
choreographers to, to create
that sound but

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.900
every time someone turns it on
I see them smile.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.400
And they laugh.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.350
The feel of the rubber
prototyping and there&#39;s one

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.580
manufacturer in world that was
able to make the rubber at

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.290
the quality and durometer that
we wanted and

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.540
the colors that we wanted for
the first Jambox.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.608
Right, so all of those little
magical details how to

00:17:35.608 --> 00:17:37.120
resolve, even in software,
right.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.350
When we had the first up and
when it plugged in and

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.400
your sleep graph showed up.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.024
Even just the animations of
how,

00:17:42.024 --> 00:17:44.054
you know, the bars would show
up and, and

00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:46.379
the way the cards would, would
flow in and out.

00:17:46.379 --> 00:17:47.923
That was a detail that we had
thought about,

00:17:47.923 --> 00:17:48.968
how&#39;s this going to interact,

00:17:48.968 --> 00:17:50.389
how&#39;s the user going to
experience that,

00:17:50.389 --> 00:17:51.450
how&#39;re they going to feel it?

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.970
Right, so this, a lot of that
kind of stuff happens even at

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.570
this stage where you sign off
on a program it&#39;s going.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.580
But you&#39;re making those kinds
of decisions all the way

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.290
through and you&#39;re trading
them off and

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.480
you&#39;re doing it in the context
of, of this bigger picture.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.750
So and continued innovation is
an opportunity to keep

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.960
refining, keep doing all that
stuff so.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.870
So how do we think about it
now you know it, kind of

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.800
at a broader level, sort of
what is the framework for

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.610
how we think about these
signature experiences?

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.730
Well we do start with these
why&#39;s.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.300
Right, which is that
articulation of

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.190
a problem that we&#39;re solving.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.920
And then the themes around how
these

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.480
become actionable concepts,
right?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.550
And then there&#39;s, there&#39;s what
we do is we build these

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.680
cross functional pods that
take a person from the product

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.670
experience team, a person from
hardware engineering,

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.450
a person from software
engineering.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.177
A person from the data team,
and we put them together and

00:18:40.177 --> 00:18:41.454
they&#39;re kind of person,

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:44.486
there&#39;s, this is the pod that
owns that theme or that track.

00:18:44.486 --> 00:18:45.821
And they continue to sort of

00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:47.970
build that out against the
hero features and

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.540
inside features into how we
put that together.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.830
So, I&#39;m going to go in now in,
into more specifics around

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.260
what we call these why&#39;s,
because this is where I,

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.910
I spend a lot of my time
really asking a question.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.020
And what it does is it serves
as a really interesting

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.080
framework for us to be able to
come back and say,

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.170
hey do we meet those questions
that we ask?

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.070
Does this thing actually do
it?

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.150
And it serves also as a really
good guide post for

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.210
a lot of our creativity and a
lot of our innovation so

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.290
that it&#39;s not unbridled,
right?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.720
So, it really comes down to a
very simple question for us.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.660
Which is, what is the user
problem that we solve

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.300
through this experience,
whether it&#39;s in hardware,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.580
software, data, platform,
whatever it is.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.350
That once we solve it people
can&#39;t live without it, right?

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.130
They may have a absolutely
burning need to go solve this

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.120
problem and they can&#39;t, you
know,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.840
they, they&#39;re looking for a
solution.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.790
Or it&#39;s things like, you know,

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.840
that once you have it you
never thought you needed it,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.120
but now you can&#39;t live without
it, right?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.210
And again, the Jambox is a
great of example of that.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.562
We did, you know, we talked to
some people when we

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.748
were thinking about making
that product, and

00:19:50.748 --> 00:19:52.162
it was interesting because.

00:19:52.162 --> 00:19:53.193
Little story for

00:19:53.193 --> 00:19:57.093
you guys, when we launched the
Jambox in the fall of 2010,

00:19:57.093 --> 00:20:00.258
the market for wireless
speakers as a percentage of

00:20:00.258 --> 00:20:03.583
the overall speaker market was
0%, right, 0%.

00:20:03.583 --> 00:20:05.615
Last Christmas, which was you
know,

00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:08.930
Christmas of 2013, it was 78%
of the market, right.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.640
So in a few years we were able
to transform this entire

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.420
industry that&#39;d been around
for you know,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.930
since the 50s and 60s, turn it
on its head.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.330
And if I had gone out and
asked a bunch of people and

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.630
I said who wants, who wants
$199 speaker for

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.980
your mobile phone.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.902
I guarantee you that in that
focus group 0% of

00:20:25.902 --> 00:20:28.071
those people would have said
that I want that thing or

00:20:28.071 --> 00:20:29.961
I need it or that I&#39;d be
willing to pay for it.

00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:30.968
But yet when we did it,

00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:32.670
it transformed an industry,
right?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.056
And so what we, and, and

00:20:34.056 --> 00:20:36.960
this is where these why&#39;s
become super important,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.700
is just really focusing in on
what you&#39;re doing, right?

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.264
And I&#39;ll go through one
example in the audio space

00:20:43.264 --> 00:20:45.584
which is the Jambox example in
the audio, and

00:20:45.584 --> 00:20:48.575
then I&#39;ll take you through a
little bit of how we did it

00:20:48.575 --> 00:20:50.308
in op in particular UP24.

00:20:50.308 --> 00:20:52.216
But it starts with what we
call kind of our,

00:20:52.216 --> 00:20:53.490
our category strategy, and

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.675
this is the sort of experience
framework right?

00:20:55.675 --> 00:20:58.986
And, and our view was, look,
all of your content and

00:20:58.986 --> 00:21:01.570
media experiences are now on
your phone.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.100
All right, they are no longer
on your iPad, iPod, or

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.730
your computer.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.140
And so we need a different way
to interact with it

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.450
that needs to be as mobile, as
portable, as high quality.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.450
All right, that was our, our
fundamental thinking.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:16.287
And then we said that
experience needs to

00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:19.045
be seamless across time and
space, so anywhere through it,

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:21.153
different car, you know,
traveling, in and

00:21:21.153 --> 00:21:23.206
out of your house, around the
house, that,

00:21:23.206 --> 00:21:26.072
that was fundamentally what we
were doing and we said: that&#39;s

00:21:26.072 --> 00:21:28.811
the whole point of why this
category should exist, right?

00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:30.970
And that was the human
problem.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.160
And then we said, okay, what&#39;s
in it for Jawbone?

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.850
Right, why, why should we do
this?

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.580
And so if you think about that
broader macro context that I

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.910
was talking around, the
internet of things, for us,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.170
this was our entry into your
home, right?

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.630
And so while everybody talks
about all these new things in

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.090
your house from, you know,

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.800
lights and, and thermostats
and cable boxes and

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.360
fridges and, and, you know,
smoke alarms or whatever,

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.650
being connected, media&#39;s still
the killer app in your house.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.410
It&#39;s where we sell millions
and millions and

00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:58.810
millions of units, right?

00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:59.890
So we said, well speakers can
be

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.480
our entry into that world
that&#39;s around you.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.420
And, and it can be the hub of
things that we want to do from

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.250
a software and service
perspective in your home.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.490
So there&#39;s, there&#39;s this
interesting strategy both,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:11.510
at solving user problem, but

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.700
then why does it matter to
Java?

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.690
So those two have to go
together because, you know, A,

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.570
we&#39;re not in, you know,
philanthropic, not for

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.210
profit industry, but B, this
is, if you do this well,

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.050
it allows you to keep doing
great products, and

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.870
it allows you to keep moving
forward, and

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:27.700
doing interesting things.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.120
So that&#39;s sort of how we put
that together.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.200
And then we built this sort
of,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.460
what we think the experience,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.760
what we call the experience
continuum is.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.440
Where is it today, right?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.090
And when we started it was a
Bluetooth speaker, right?

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.300
That was the core enabling
technology that allowed us to

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.410
connect to stuff.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.640
Where do we think that it&#39;s
going to go tomorrow?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.800
And then, what happens when we
can dream in

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.000
the future, right?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.140
And we start to really try to
live in tomorrow and

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.010
the future and

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.290
the sort of thing about what
we build today as a gradu,

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.940
as a stepping stone to
graduate users starting in

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.620
one place, continue to move,
continue to move through that.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.690
And that gives us a view of
how we also make

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.240
these trade offs, right?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:05.900
because we said, you know
what,

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.820
we&#39;re not going to put this
into this product, but

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.440
we got a spacer in the next
one and we know that we can

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.650
move users to that and they&#39;ll
be ready for it, right?

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.170
and, and that&#39;s, that&#39;s a lot
of,

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.840
of, of the way we build stuff
is we sort of

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.320
define that experience
continuum right?

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.070
And then it&#39;s, and then we, we
do talk about this a lot.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.360
We don&#39;t think of ourselves as
a hardware team or

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.830
software team or data company
or whatever it is.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.470
We think of ourselves as an
experiences company, right?

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.640
It&#39;s not just about that
physical device or

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.490
the feature, the object, it&#39;s
about the system,

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.760
it&#39;s about how the pieces come
together.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.110
And so when we start to define
these whys,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.390
they become the problem
statement, and

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.870
we say okay, how do we use a
piece of hardware.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.890
How do we use the service in
the cloud?

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.400
How do we use, you know, an
application, a sound, a button

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.140
to solve this user experience
problem that we have?

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.190
And what&#39;s the right
distribution across that

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:59.230
system of where you should
attack the problem, right?

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.250
And where do we need to
innovate?

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.080
And where do we need to pull
together?

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.780
So that&#39;s a big, big, big part
of the thinking.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.730
It helps us do it, right?

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.530
And, you know, it, it, it&#39;s
when we think about these here

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.850
experiences, right, we, we say
it&#39;s really around the context

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.330
of why it&#39;s magical to the
user, right?

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:16.930
And then like I said,

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.620
the system is a flagship, and
then it has to go

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.710
to the level of emotional
connection, right?

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.590
Where you feel without it
you&#39;re lost.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.790
Like, I&#39;m going to go back
home and

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.190
get it if I don&#39;t have it,
right?

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.060
And so those are the kind of

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.070
principles that govern all
these things.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.410
And we have to keep asking
ourselves those questions,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:34.070
is it doing that?

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.010
So we pull this all together
in experience framework.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.040
This becomes essentially a
brief for

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.130
your engineering team and your
design team, and

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.630
all the people that work on
this in the company.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:44.870
That they can go back to and

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.230
say, what are we doing, and
why are we doing it?

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.990
And how does that work?

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.980
And then how do we create
against that, right?

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.460
And then we have a sort of
whole process,

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.620
Blueberry is one of the
internal code names.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.950
But the user experience
process starts with

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:57.700
a better resource, so

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.840
we do actually listen to users
and talk to &#39;em.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.610
But we talk to &#39;em in a very
specific way.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.910
Start looking for those key
insights.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.490
We concept &#39;em and then we
start to build, right?

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.850
And this is why we go to find
those lists of

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.060
consumer problems.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.890
The principles, how do we
think about approaching that?

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.350
What are the solutions?

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.080
And then what&#39;s

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.750
required in the product to
make that happen.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.250
Sam?

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.030
&gt;&gt; Could, could you talk about
how you balance the fact that

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.470
a user would never, told you
they wanted to pay $200 for

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.240
a wireless speaker.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; With user research in

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.500
front of this process.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.760
Well, there&#39;s two different,
there&#39;s two different,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.780
there&#39;s a lot of layers to, to
users research, right?

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:34.890
So what we look at,

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.480
that&#39;s a great question, so
there&#39;s, there&#39;s, you know,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.940
you guys probably aren&#39;t
familiar enough with this yet,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.510
but there are sort of standard
tools for

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.790
what people do in focus
grouping, where they say,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.900
you know, would you try this,
would you do,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.430
would you pay this, do you
want this feature,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.130
do I want this feature, what
do you care about.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.320
That&#39;s one way to do it.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.790
And we don&#39;t usually get there
is really great answers.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.420
We ask different kinds of
questions.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.710
We say, you know, how much
music do you listen to

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.470
when you are with other
people?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.820
Wha, how do you play that
music?

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.200
Do you listen to a headphones,
or

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.560
do you listen over the
speakers on your,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.950
on your phone, okay.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.120
How often are you with other
people?

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.440
How often do you want a
personalized experience?

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.460
How often do you want to
share?

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.030
How often do you?

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.930
So, we ask, like, we ask a lot
of questions.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.420
We just ask different ones.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.030
And we don&#39;t ask them specific
things about,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.410
do you want this or do you
want that.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.640
We ask them: how do they
behave?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.040
How do they live?

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.920
And you say to them,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.010
hey, if you had something that
allowed you to take, you know?

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:26.950
A great example is iPod,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.960
If you said to somebody, you
know,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.600
if you could put a thousand
songs in your pocket and

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.180
take them anywhere, that&#39;s
cool.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.690
Not do you want

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.820
a digital portable music
player that, you know?

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.230
So again it&#39;s, it&#39;s at a price
that was, you know,

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.040
more than your phone, right?

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.380
So, you know, you gotta, you
sort of have to separate what

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.580
are questions that you can ask
that are going to

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.690
help make you smarter about
your thesis versus trying to

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.060
get somebody to validate it
for you, right?

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.660
And I think that&#39;s the real
separation.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.560
Is it&#39;s that,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.440
no one&#39;s going to tell you
what to build,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.080
if they do then they should do
it, right, and not you.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.410
And so you, you&#39;re the one
who&#39;s making that decision,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.970
you&#39;ve got the thesis, you&#39;ve
got the creative idea,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.390
you&#39;ve got the innovation.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.550
You gotta use these people to
help you make it better and

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:10.610
to refine your thinking.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.520
That&#39;s the difference.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.020
Make sense?

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:14.680
Okay.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.620
So, I&#39;m going to switch over
to some Up24,

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.080
which is the product that
we&#39;ve had on the market, our,

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.940
our wireless products for
health tracking.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.550
And the whys of Up24 are
really simple, right?

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.060
Well, first of all, let me
start with the whys for Up.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.610
The idea there was there&#39;s so

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.830
much that we know about the
world today, through Twitter,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.400
Facebook, social media, access
to the internet, Google,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.350
et cetera, but we know nothing
about ourselves.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.340
We have no idea why some days
I sleep eight hours and

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.080
feel terrible some days I
sleep three and feel awesome.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.440
Like I just have no idea,
right?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.900
And so I, our thought was:
could we take a lot of

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.930
this sensor technology, ma,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.960
help people understand more
about themselves and start to

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.690
then make better decisions
about how they live better.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.190
So this, that was the first
product.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.599
This was the second product we
said: okay,

00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:05.130
great, now that we have
wireless connectivity,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.030
it&#39;s not just about Bluetooth
or wireless,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.870
it&#39;s about the fact that I can
use that real time flow of

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.480
information to understand
what&#39;s happening with me, and,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.860
and, and go, and take action
on it, right?

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.500
I can get the data in a more
meaningful, relevant,

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.600
contextually important way at
the moment that it matters.

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.030
I can also get back guidance
in

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.630
a structured way that can help
me go do things.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.410
And I want that ongoing
encouragement,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.910
because everybody, you know,

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.060
knows that they want to be
better, but

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.980
they fall down or do whatever.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.080
And they want to, a fluid way
to interact with this.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.550
So this is what we, we&#39;re sort
of building in Up24, right?

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:43.640
We had this very crisp set of
five things that were

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.610
the whys of why we&#39;re building
this product and

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.240
why we&#39;re doing it.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.190
And our point of view was that
it was going to,

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.310
we had this sort of
fundamental narrative going,

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.740
going back to the experience
framework where we

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.590
said everything we do in UP is
about, you know,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.500
helping people track and
understand them,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.040
track themselves, was
understand, which is

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.840
taking all that data and
converting it into knowledge.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.570
And then the third part was
act, so

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:07.570
track, understand, and act.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.850
That is our narrative for
everything we do in the,

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.000
in the kind of wearable health
space, fundamental.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.860
And, and it will be for, for
the entirety of what we do.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.820
It&#39;s sort of, help people get
more information on results.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.450
Data is great, understanding
is better,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.670
convert that into things that
they can, have,

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.860
create real knowledge that
they can then take action on.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.000
So anything that we can do to
keep the device on, get more

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.410
information, help them be
engaged and then find ways of,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.240
of guiding that behavior was
really, really interesting and

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.670
this is the sort of framework
for the system.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.390
And then you can start to
think about, well,

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.930
that designs how you build
your data infrastructure,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.420
your insight system, how you
process it,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.470
how you build the application
experience that surfaces it.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.610
And this is a little bit more
of a blowout around track,

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.350
understand and act, right?

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.650
So we got it in and, and this
is, the, the tracking part is

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.550
really fundamentally about the
hardware too.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.540
It&#39;s sort of, how do you
design the batteries?

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.930
How do you design the embedded
systems and materials?

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:02.210
The way it latches on you.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.390
How easy is it?

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.100
So that you keep,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.100
create the habit of keeping it
on your body, right?

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.520
Then you gotta take all that
data, and

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.510
it&#39;s not just visualization of
information.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.840
Like, you know, if I told you
you guys&#39; heart rate was 75,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.530
is that good or bad?

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.450
Who knows the answer to that
question?

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.080
I don&#39;t.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.370
It depends, right, on what
you&#39;re doing and

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.430
who you are and, and what&#39;s
happening.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.560
So just the data surfacing is
not enough.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.680
You gotta contextualize why
that matters,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.940
turn it into action.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.220
And that&#39;s the third part,
right?

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.380
Is action is the key.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.960
So let me understand the data.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.040
Let me understand that when I
work out at four o&#39;clock,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.430
I get four more hours of deep
sleep at night.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.450
That&#39;s awesome.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.590
So let me, like, get a
reminder at four o&#39;clock to go

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.820
work out, or do whatever,
right?

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:42.780
And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve built.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.920
And that&#39;s a lot of
infrastructure to sort of

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.620
create that experience.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.990
But that&#39;s how we build
software.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.120
That&#39;s how we build hardware.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.900
That&#39;s how we build sort of
the whole system.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.730
And then often, we, we will
talk about different kinds of

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.410
users and what they care about
and what we think our user

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.810
base is made of and, you know,
who&#39;s more into weight loss,

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:06.600
who wants the sort of social
acceptance,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.558
who, are, people who are vain,
that just want to look better.

00:31:10.558 --> 00:31:12.680
and, and why, it&#39;s, it&#39;s true.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.877
So, you know, there&#39;s lots of
different things.

00:31:14.877 --> 00:31:16.787
And we, and there are people
who have, sort of,

00:31:16.787 --> 00:31:18.521
medical reasons for the use of
our product.

00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:21.120
And we design different kinds
of experiences, right?

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.868
And we think about using.

00:31:22.868 --> 00:31:24.915
The platforms like the phones
and, and

00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:26.528
ways to push notifications and

00:31:26.528 --> 00:31:28.460
as part of the system think,
right.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.980
We think of notifications as a
tool for

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.110
behavior change, right?

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.550
And the we actually start to
go map out these things.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:37.280
What is a smart action?

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.470
Right, is it real time, is it
feel customizable,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:40.920
does it feel progressive, does
it help me,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.140
is it really tailored to me?

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.820
Right?
And then for

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.330
this particular type of user,
we&#39;d go out and

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.600
storyboard and then,

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.010
these storyboards go to our,
our design engineering teams.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:51.730
We work together and

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.050
they actually start to build
off of this.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:54.780
And what his does for

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.050
us is it creates a nice set of
constraints.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.550
You know, my experience has
been constraints are really

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.050
great because they serve as
opportunities to resolve,

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.600
to refine,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.650
to simplify and push you to
find the right answer that is,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.680
that it will solve the user
problem in the simplest way.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.180
Right?
And so we, we create a lot of

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.610
those constraints around what
we&#39;re doing.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.020
This is this is the, the sort
of storyboarding for,

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.260
you know, getting someone to
the goal and, and

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.370
how they do it and what we use
in, in real time.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.520
So and then, and

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.020
then we put in sort of the
secondary experiences right?

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.800
Which is if we can do this and
we can fit it in,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.710
it&#39;s not too cluttered or
confusing we&#39;ll put it in.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.753
So that&#39;s a little bit of a
snap shot in the,

00:32:36.753 --> 00:32:38.908
into how we build and we&#39;ve
few minutes left so

00:32:38.908 --> 00:32:40.691
I&#39;d love to answer any
questions or.

00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:44.001
Yeah the person&#39;s great.

00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:45.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.800
&gt;&gt; Got about 15 minutes.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.378
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; So

00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:50.242
let&#39;s say you have this
product right,

00:32:50.242 --> 00:32:52.399
you have all these features
that you want to do right,

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:53.198
all these things.

00:32:53.198 --> 00:32:53.969
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:58.390
&gt;&gt; To satisfy and you&#39;re into
your design process right?

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.280
How do you approach the whole
problem right?

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.655
How do you break it down so
that it&#39;s all business?

00:33:03.655 --> 00:33:07.564
To satisfy, you know, this
problem in this way, right?

00:33:07.564 --> 00:33:08.325
But then,

00:33:08.325 --> 00:33:12.222
cause each design feature is
not mutually exclusive.

00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:14.194
How do you project
holistically?

00:33:14.194 --> 00:33:15.023
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:15.023 --> 00:33:16.827
&gt;&gt; Sort of.

00:33:16.827 --> 00:33:18.530
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the question
for the recording?

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.874
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I mean, so that, I,

00:33:19.874 --> 00:33:23.247
I think the question was when
you have a number of different

00:33:23.247 --> 00:33:26.176
features and functions that
you&#39;re trying to build,

00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:29.039
how do you look at it at a
system level to understand not

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.523
within that one silo what the
trade offs are but

00:33:31.523 --> 00:33:34.226
what the trade offs are across
the entire system?

00:33:34.226 --> 00:33:36.009
I think that&#39;s the answer to
your question.

00:33:36.009 --> 00:33:39.423
You do exactly that, you don&#39;t
think about it in one silo.

00:33:39.423 --> 00:33:40.510
You have to force a lot of,

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.883
you know, when it&#39;s a small
team, it&#39;s really easy because

00:33:42.883 --> 00:33:45.050
you guys are all sitting
around the table.

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.010
You&#39;re looking at each other.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.070
You&#39;re making those decisions
in real time.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.501
As you get bigger and a larger
company, you have to force

00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:54.714
a lot of communication where
everyone is in a room and

00:33:54.714 --> 00:33:58.510
they, that person says, you
know, what if you build, if I,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:01.027
if you were contraining this
way.

00:34:01.027 --> 00:34:05.697
Then I can&#39;t get the quality
spec that you need me to make.

00:34:05.697 --> 00:34:08.005
And this guy&#39;s going to say
well, if you do that, and

00:34:08.005 --> 00:34:10.367
you give me that much space,
then I can&#39;t fit all the

00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:13.050
algorithms in at the battery
performance that you want.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.508
And so when you start to look
across the system,

00:34:15.508 --> 00:34:18.585
you start to see everyone has
to share what their pains are.

00:34:18.585 --> 00:34:19.333
And they actually don&#39;t
understand.

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:21.550
If I make this tradeoff, it&#39;s
going to affect me over here.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.610
And so you have to put them
all together in a room,

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.790
and start hashing that.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:26.880
But what&#39;s on the board and on
the walls, and

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.800
on everywhere, is what are we
trying to do?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.320
And does that, does that
tradeoff still meet it, right?

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.500
Across all those, all those
different silos.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.260
Because everyone&#39;s thinking
about the tradeoffs in

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.720
their and they know what they
need to accomplish, right?

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.654
But again, it is how does that
affect the whole thing.

00:34:41.654 --> 00:34:43.551
We just went through this with
three,

00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:46.160
which is a product we are
shipping in a couple of weeks

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.946
that sort of defined the next
wave of what is happening in

00:34:48.946 --> 00:34:51.720
the wearable space on the
health tracking side.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.360
We invented a totally new
sensing system, right?

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.240
There was raw science that had
been developed that we

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.670
prioritized really fast, and

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.890
even just trade offs on what
the electrode materials were.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.460
How it affects on reliability,
sourcing, you know,

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.490
signal performance.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.200
And they just, these guys
weren&#39;t talking to each other.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.330
We had to get in a room.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.800
Do daily calls for three
hours,

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.180
where they&#39;re going thru each
of their things.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.830
It tedious, but we&#39;re figuring
it out.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:15.470
We knock it down.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:16.060
So it&#39;s a little.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.060
When you, when you&#39;re small
it&#39;s

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.886
really easy because your just,
sure I&#39;ll look at it.

00:35:18.886 --> 00:35:21.690
But you have to always have
that definition of what

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.630
you&#39;re trying to do across the
system, and that&#39;s why a lot

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:25.700
of what I was talking about
was much higher level.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.950
What problem are we solving?

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.330
Where&#39;s it go over time and

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:29.620
then how do all these pieces
inform it?

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.890
Go ahead.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.930
&gt;&gt; If a startup wants to build
a system eventually, should

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.842
it start focusing on one small
thing or should it start

00:35:37.842 --> 00:35:40.964
looking at systems itself and
how to do them altogether.

00:35:40.964 --> 00:35:43.342
&gt;&gt; How do you get, I think
system think is, is,

00:35:43.342 --> 00:35:45.630
it&#39;s a way, it&#39;s a mindset.

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.060
Right?
It&#39;s not a,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.350
it&#39;s not actually a system
like the simple systems,

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:51.520
there are complex ones.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.820
You know, I, the, the, you
know, a plane is

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.033
a very complex system, a car
is a very complex system.

00:35:58.033 --> 00:35:58.950
There&#39;s other products,

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:00.360
we make that a more simpler
phone as

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.720
a complex an application, you
should think of as a system.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.270
Right?

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.500
And how all the pieces work
together.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.930
Your storage you know, the fun
and experience, what you&#39;re

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.360
doing, the connectivity,
that&#39;s all a system, right?

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.395
And so that&#39;s more what we
mean about system.

00:36:13.395 --> 00:36:13.949
Yes, for

00:36:13.949 --> 00:36:16.718
us, system is hardware,
software and data but

00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:20.467
I think within even anything,
there&#39;s always system things.

00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:22.915
And so it&#39;s more just thinking
about how trade offs work

00:36:22.915 --> 00:36:25.377
across all the different
pieces as they come together.

00:36:25.377 --> 00:36:26.023
Does that make sense?

00:36:26.023 --> 00:36:27.318
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:28.315
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:36:28.315 --> 00:36:29.242
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:36:29.242 --> 00:36:33.654
What&#39;s the decision making
process between creating like

00:36:33.654 --> 00:36:36.195
related products in the same
space?

00:36:36.195 --> 00:36:40.195
Like for fitness tracking,
there&#39;s different versions of,

00:36:40.195 --> 00:36:41.405
for, for Jambox.

00:36:41.405 --> 00:36:43.059
Use different versions of
Jambox.

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:45.750
And, you know, what goes into
that?

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.190
&gt;&gt; We do have a grand unified
theory.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.280
At some point.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.130
Around how these experiences
come together.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:53.981
And what happens and it
touches a little bit

00:36:53.981 --> 00:36:55.842
that point that I was making
to you around.

00:36:55.842 --> 00:36:58.345
A context engine, when you
have things on your body that

00:36:58.345 --> 00:37:01.200
can make everything in the
world around you smarter.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.870
Like if I know the emotional
state of a user,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.720
I can tell Spotify what song
it should play you

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.350
on the jam box, right?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.860
I can tell the TV that you
didn&#39;t like that commercial,

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.170
they should fast forward to
the next one.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.990
Or I can tell you not to watch
Game of Thrones on

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.040
a Sunday night, because you
don&#39;t sleep well.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.280
Right?
And so you start to see

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.550
I&#39;m serious, right?

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.790
And so these pieces start to,
to go together.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.155
And so we do think at that
level, and then we start to

00:37:23.155 --> 00:37:25.415
say what are the building
blocks that get there?

00:37:25.415 --> 00:37:26.840
Now how do we establish
credibility?

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.931
How do we establish a
distribution system?

00:37:28.931 --> 00:37:30.953
How do we establish
manufacturing scale?

00:37:30.953 --> 00:37:32.770
How do these pieces start to
come together?

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.710
So there is a grand unified
vision for us.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.880
And, and we look at different
categories and

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.860
different categories have
different dynamics.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.150
They move at different paces.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.070
They have different
replacement cycles.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.640
A great example of this right
now is what&#39;s going on

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.390
with iPad and iPhone.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.400
We&#39;re all very used to

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.830
replacing our phones every
single year.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.890
iPads are not following that
same trajectory, right?

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.470
So the replacement cycle is
different.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.970
The use case is different.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.760
The problem its solving is
different.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.250
So you&#39;ve gotta adapt to that,
right?

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.040
You don&#39;t replace your nest
every year.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.600
It&#39;s a 15 year install, so how
do they build in that kind of

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.450
a world and how do they think
about.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.250
So it&#39;s just, you gotta think
about your category,

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.160
the replacement cycle,

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.740
the usage, how these things
come together and, and

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.646
the dynamics are different.

00:38:11.646 --> 00:38:12.232
Right?

00:38:12.232 --> 00:38:13.131
Go ahead.

00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:19.011
&gt;&gt; First of all, how you would
canvas this unique.

00:38:19.011 --> 00:38:21.075
Community of Babylon was to
face?

00:38:21.075 --> 00:38:24.307
And it&#39;s a you have this idea,
or

00:38:24.307 --> 00:38:27.115
you think the functionality is
somewhat important?

00:38:27.115 --> 00:38:28.097
&gt;&gt; Which piece are you talking
about?

00:38:28.097 --> 00:38:28.798
You&#39;re talking about the
texture?

00:38:28.798 --> 00:38:30.874
&gt;&gt; The texture, yeah.

00:38:30.874 --> 00:38:32.110
&gt;&gt; Need a tech show.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:34.220
Succeeding at every job and
product.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.049
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.
A lot of

00:38:35.049 --> 00:38:37.840
that was developed by, by Eve
and our design team.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.900
And, and sort of, you know,
coming up with a branded look.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.500
So that, you know,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.660
you saw the icon and you knew
what it was, right?

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.360
Whether it&#39;s here or, or
anything.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.110
So that was part of, sort of,
our, our mission.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.340
We wanted to convey a certain
emotional quality, etcetera.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.800
Some people like it, some
people don&#39;t.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.760
That&#39;s sort of the nature of
the design.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.970
But that was all part of the
same process.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:57.560
Right?

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.060
Go ahead.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.800
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.387
&gt;&gt; yeah, so.
This is kind of going off of

00:39:02.387 --> 00:39:03.356
the other questions.

00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:05.563
But when you get a certain
product,

00:39:05.563 --> 00:39:08.168
how does your processing
unnecessarily changed, and

00:39:08.168 --> 00:39:10.262
how do you take into account
information you

00:39:10.262 --> 00:39:13.109
might have learned from, let&#39;s
say, like,.

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:15.421
Like how does the framework
and processes work?

00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:16.776
&gt;&gt; that&#39;s, it&#39;s a good
question.

00:39:16.776 --> 00:39:18.000
I&#39;m actually going to go back
to that.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.355
So the question was, it&#39;s sort
of not on the initial product,

00:39:21.355 --> 00:39:23.826
but as you&#39;ve launched the
initial product,

00:39:23.826 --> 00:39:25.599
what happens to your thinking
and

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:28.210
how does that evolve the
process, right?

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:31.348
So I&#39;m going to, going to take
it back to that,

00:39:31.348 --> 00:39:35.443
that slide that shows the
kind of the how we create and

00:39:35.443 --> 00:39:38.509
the process flow, right here.

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:44.179
So, sorry I gotta go through
these builds.

00:39:44.179 --> 00:39:47.910
So it&#39;s actually a great
question.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.250
So this is, you know,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.190
say this is you&#39;re starting
something totally new from,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.430
from scratch, and you come out
here and

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:55.960
you do all this stuff and you
get it to here.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.090
And then you learn a lot.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.470
And in the first iteration of
Up,

00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.958
you know, in 2011, it broke.

00:39:59.958 --> 00:40:00.544
It didn&#39;t work.

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:02.776
So we had to actually go back
to the drawing board.

00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:05.624
And so what that did here is
we actually ended up

00:40:05.624 --> 00:40:08.982
telling these guys a bunch of
things that they should be

00:40:08.982 --> 00:40:10.151
thinking about and

00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:13.306
sort of unlocking a lot of
problems we had to solve.

00:40:13.306 --> 00:40:14.950
That they then started working
on

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.416
it at a different pace because
sometimes this will

00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:19.008
take years to come to
fruition.

00:40:19.008 --> 00:40:22.371
We can dream a lot faster that
what&#39;s possible, right?

00:40:22.371 --> 00:40:25.434
And so even at core technology
levels it censored.

00:40:25.434 --> 00:40:28.810
Batteries, I mean, chips,
right?

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:30.040
You know, processing.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.120
What we can do with storage.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.390
Like, all that kind of stuff.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:33.610
We&#39;ll say, well you know what?

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.540
If we have,

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.660
those are the problems that
we&#39;re facing, what if we start

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.910
running parallel threads to go
fix that.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.200
And so we&#39;ll, we&#39;ll start
doing some work here.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.010
They&#39;ll look at it in

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.050
different parts of the
process.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.220
So there&#39;s room for innovation
in all these different things.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:48.700
But we may see something here
that we say.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.240
Let&#39;s go straight into
planning and development.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.190
We don&#39;t need to go all the
way back, right?

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.510
So we have the flexibility to
sort of jump through and

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.310
say we don&#39;t need to do these
things.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.120
We know that.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.050
Like it wasn&#39;t a big struggle
for us to know to go

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.540
from a solution to plug in to
go wireless.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.493
Like I wasn&#39;t concerned that
we had to a lot of

00:41:05.493 --> 00:41:06.984
concept evaluating.

00:41:06.984 --> 00:41:08.568
Right?
So we can kind of skip through

00:41:08.568 --> 00:41:10.878
those steps if you know how to
make those decisions.

00:41:10.878 --> 00:41:14.302
But this is more for us in a
lot of ways is a way of kind

00:41:14.302 --> 00:41:18.058
of taking a lot of innovative
spirit and creativity and

00:41:18.058 --> 00:41:22.180
giving it a very focused way
to actually get out.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.190
Right?

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.115
And so that, that&#39;s what we
think about.

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:26.839
We have the ability to sort of
go back and forth and

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:28.571
skip over steps as necessary.

00:41:28.571 --> 00:41:29.421
Go ahead.

00:41:29.421 --> 00:41:32.564
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m just curious how large
is in terms of the number of

00:41:32.564 --> 00:41:35.405
employees and then as you&#39;ve
added more employees what

00:41:35.405 --> 00:41:38.246
were some of the kinks that
you encountered of having you

00:41:38.246 --> 00:41:39.888
know, not just a group of
five.

00:41:39.888 --> 00:41:42.278
But more people working on one
project, and

00:41:42.278 --> 00:41:44.151
then everybody getting heard,
or

00:41:44.151 --> 00:41:47.648
some organizational tools to,
to facilitate that.

00:41:47.648 --> 00:41:49.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:49.757
That&#39;s a good question.

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:51.485
So the question is how big are
we.

00:41:51.485 --> 00:41:54.300
&gt;&gt; And then as we grew from,
you know, few to many how did

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.306
it change our, our thinking
around process and tools and

00:41:57.306 --> 00:41:59.660
how we kind of work together,
right?

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.360
So we&#39;re about 500 people and
we have a very remote setup.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.300
We&#39;ve got an office is
Sunnyvale,

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.980
headquarters in San Fransisco,
offices in Seattle,

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.910
Shanghai Pittsburgh, London.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.590
And so we have a very you
know, distributed team that

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.410
poses a lot of interesting
communication zones.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.390
But also allows us to get
where the talent is and, and

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:21.640
where there are interesting
people in

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.400
specific areas that we&#39;re
doing.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.460
I would say the single biggest
thing that,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.160
that we continue to always try
to get better at is that

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.240
communication between all
these different people.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.650
Working in different ways and

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.410
forcing them to sit at the
table, and say,

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.480
here&#39;s what I&#39;m working on,
here&#39;s where my tradeoffs are.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.990
This is what I think it should
affect you.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:42.670
Listening to other people, and
sort of understanding it.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.100
And then remembering that we
are building this system and

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.440
here&#39;s what happens when all
the pieces come together.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.570
And then, how do we, we solve
problems?

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.550
But it&#39;s a lot of that,
forcing that communication.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.774
And doing things like, I, I,
literally on UP3, have a daily

00:42:55.774 --> 00:42:59.760
call that&#39;s two and a half
hours with the entire team,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.388
from materials, sourcing,
manufacturing, design sensor,

00:43:04.388 --> 00:43:08.820
you know, firmware, mechanical
engineering, all together.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.524
And they all have to sit
through each others updates

00:43:10.524 --> 00:43:12.268
and but then understand what
those tradeoffs are and

00:43:12.268 --> 00:43:14.400
I sort of for, force that
communication.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.100
So go ahead.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.360
&gt;&gt; what, at what point did you
decide to expand?

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.716
And how did you decide where
to expand to first?

00:43:24.716 --> 00:43:26.140
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re talking about geo,
so

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.060
the question is, how did we
decide to expand and when?

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.070
Are you, is that geographical,
is that our team,

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.900
was that markets?

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah who, how did, how did
you find the connections to

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:37.980
each other in the other?

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.870
&gt;&gt; I mean, I think a lot of it
some it&#39;s deliberate.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.870
You know we, we, we sort of
say obviously we,

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.410
we build a lot of things in
China, so

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.650
we need to have a presence
there and manage things.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.470
So at some point we got big
enough that we

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.540
wanted our own team on the
ground.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.760
You know, we&#39;ve expanded
sales.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.105
I think we&#39;re in 56 countries
globally,

00:43:55.105 --> 00:43:56.470
100,000 points of sale.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.360
So that was, you know, we
started in North America,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.280
we went to Europe, we went to
Asia.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.450
Now we think a little bit
differently about when we

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:03.930
launch what geographies we go
to.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.220
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s some of it&#39;s
deliberate and

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.490
planned, some of it takes
time.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.080
And again, it&#39;s part of that,
you know,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.630
we want to be here, here&#39;s how
we want to grow,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.620
we want to migrate our
business this way.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.952
And then a lot of it is also
opportunistic, right?

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:18.280
There are markets that we&#39;ve
entered where you know,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.680
we had a really good partner.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.190
We had a really, you know,
strong proposition.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:24.940
The, the culture was really
well suited to what we

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.440
were doing.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.810
You know, we, we, for UP,
China&#39;s a huge market for us.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:31.260
We went in with Apple in, in
Apple stores.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.450
And that was a great stamp of
credibility and

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.900
we sort of rode that wave.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.550
So, you know, again, it&#39;s,
it&#39;s, it,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:37.680
but we knew we wanted to be in
China, and

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.290
that was a great entry point
for us.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.510
So I think it depends on what
you&#39;re doing specifically and,

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.200
and, and, you know, what&#39;s
appropriate for

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.810
that situation.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.060
Go ahead.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.380
&gt;&gt; Why haven&#39;t you made any
headphones?

00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:53.040
&gt;&gt; I mean, you know, for us,
like any category,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.880
I get asked about a lot of
different things, you know,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.290
headphones is, is sort of one.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.080
First it&#39;s like, you know,

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.850
when we come into a space, we
want to blow it wide open and

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.520
make sure we have a
proposition that makes it

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.580
better for the user than
what&#39;s there today.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.300
And make it better in sort of
a order of magnitude or

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.330
two order of magnitudes and,
and do stuff.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.650
So, sometimes the market&#39;s not
ready.

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.030
Sometimes the technology base
isn&#39;t ready.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:18.920
Sometimes we&#39;re not ready.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.540
We don&#39;t have the right
capabilities to synthesize and

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.490
pull those pieces together.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:25.993
So, it&#39;s a combination of
factors whatever the,

00:45:25.993 --> 00:45:29.668
whatever the product or the
category is, all right?

00:45:29.668 --> 00:45:30.706
&gt;&gt; All right, one more
question.

00:45:30.706 --> 00:45:32.210
&gt;&gt; Go ahead, in the red
sweater.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.897
&gt;&gt; Hi, for a hardware company
or a system

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:36.290
company the product in recycle
is always a headache.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:40.260
Sam mentioned one early
faculty who had tried to run

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.120
a hardware company and a
software company and

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.720
I was wondering is there
anything you can share there?

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.050
Are you trying to run Jobo
more like a close a software

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:52.170
company to get user feedback
along, along the way or

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.400
along the process?

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.280
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
So I think the question was

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.470
hardware companies are sort of
hard to run,

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.100
they&#39;re different from
software companies.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.700
How are we trying to run Jobo,
right?

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.420
I would say there&#39;s no model
for what we&#39;re trying to do.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.790
It&#39;s never been done before,
so

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.730
we feel like we&#39;re at the tip
of the arrow.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.330
We&#39;re putting together
disciplines that have

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:19.030
never had to work side by side
to create experiences.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.340
It&#39;s very painful sometimes.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.270
It&#39;s very fun.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.140
We try to take the best of
everything.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.520
Try to take the best practices
of what make, you know,

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.540
rapid software iteration.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.100
Testing and

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.700
development, deployment, try
to apply that to hardware.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.800
We try to take the resolution
that you require in

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.700
hardware and apply that to
software design, because web

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.720
software is very different
than mobile software.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.170
And it turned out that
building mobile software was

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.310
actually a lot more like
building hardware.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.450
Where you actually had one
shot and

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:46.730
you had to get it right right
out of the gate.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.430
So, we try to take the lessons
from each place and

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.560
make ourselves really good.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.080
And that&#39;s my job and

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.100
that&#39;s the job of some of the
other senior leadership is to

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.290
look at those opportunities of
how you kind of

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.500
take the best of everything
and put it together.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.960
But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s ever
been a company that&#39;s

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.330
been great at, equally great
at hardware or software data.

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:07.410
And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying
to do, so.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:08.820
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.320
Thank you guys.

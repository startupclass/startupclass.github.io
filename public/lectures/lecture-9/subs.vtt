00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.558
I want to start with a
question for, for Mark and

00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:11.364
Ron which is by far the
number 1 question What made

00:00:11.364 --> 00:00:15.150
you guys decide to invest in
a founder or a company.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.140
Either of you.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.510
&gt;&gt; Start.
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.320
&gt;&gt; You first.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.870
&gt;&gt; Well we have a slide on
that.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.620
We have, we have an app for
that.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.608
&gt;&gt; Mark can start while we
try to get your slide up.

00:00:27.608 --> 00:00:28.253
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:34.989
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re running out of AV
guys, so.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.670
&gt;&gt; So say the question
again.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.170
&gt;&gt; What makes you decide to
invest in

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.090
a founder or a company?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
&gt;&gt; So what makes us invest
in a company is

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.620
based on a whole bunch of
characteristics.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
I&#39;ve been doing this since
1994,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.550
right before Mark got out of
the University of Illinois.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.080
So, SV Angel and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.610
it&#39;s entities have invested
in over 700 companies.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.890
So, to invest in 700
companies that means we&#39;ve

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.630
physically talked to
thousands of entrepreneurs.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.480
And there&#39;s a whole bunch of
things that

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.130
just go through my head when
I meet an entrepreneur.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.850
And I&#39;m just going to talk
about what some of

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.469
those are.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.760
And literally while you&#39;re
talking to me in

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.610
the first minute I&#39;m saying,
is this person a leader?

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.550
You know, is this person
rifled, focused and

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.290
obsessed by the product.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.220
I&#39;m hoping cuz usually the
first question I ask is what

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.260
inspired you to invent this
product.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.640
I&#39;m hoping that it&#39;s based
on a personal problem that,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.470
that founder had and

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.500
this product is the solution
to that personal problem.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.100
Then I&#39;m looking for
communication skills.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
Because if you&#39;re gonna be a
leader and hire a team,.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.860
Assuming your product is
successful you&#39;ve gotta be

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.730
a really good communicator
and you,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.440
you have to be a born
leader.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.110
Now some of that you might
have to learn those

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.710
traits of leadership but you
better take charge and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.910
be able to be a leader.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.849
I&#39;ll switch back to slide
but let&#39;s let Mark.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, I agree with all
that,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.600
I guess, and there&#39;s a lot
of detail to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.570
this question that we could
talk about.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.210
And we maybe even a little
bit different than Ron,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.330
and, well we are different
than Ron,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.940
that we actually invested
across stages.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.180
So we invested the seed
stage, the interest stage,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.090
the growth stage.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.360
And then we invest in a
variety of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.740
different business models,
consumer enterprise, and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.690
a bunch of variations.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.687
So, there are kind of fine
grained answers, you know,

00:02:37.687 --> 00:02:38.536
that we could get into,

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:39.779
if there are specific
questions.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.090
Two general concepts that I
would share.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.260
So one is the venture
capital business is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.090
a 100% a game of outliers.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.330
It&#39;s extreme exceptions.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.502
Right?
So the conventional

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:51.369
statistics are,

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:55.080
you know, on the order,of
4,000 venture fundable.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.910
Companies a year that wanna
raise venture capital about,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.740
you know, about 200 of those
will get funded by

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.910
what&#39;s considered a top tier
VC.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.890
About 15 of those will
someday get to $100 million

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.990
in revenue and those 15 from
that year will generate

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.700
something on the order of
97% of all the returns.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.210
For the entire category of

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.100
venture capital in that
year.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.710
And so venture capital is
such an extreme feat for

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.480
family business.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.830
You&#39;re either in one of the
fifteen or your not.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.120
Or you&#39;re in one of the two
hundred or your not.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.680
And so the big thing that
your looking for

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.010
no matter you know which
sort of

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.330
particular kind of criteria
we talk about.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.509
They all have the
characteristic of

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:30.930
you&#39;re looking for the
extreme outlier.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.450
The other thing I&#39;d
highlight that we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.170
think about a lot internally
is we have this

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.170
concept invest in strength
versus lack of weakness.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.410
And at first that sounds
obvious but

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.590
it&#39;s actually fairly subtle
which is sort of the default

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.870
way to do venture capital is
to kinda check boxes, right?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.670
So you know, really good
founder, really good idea,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.880
you know really good, you
know, products, really good

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.060
initial customers, check
check check check.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.580
Okay, if this is reasonable,
I&#39;ll put money in it.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.890
What you find with those,
those sorta checkbox deals.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.900
So they get, they get done
all the time.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.510
What you find is they don&#39;t
have something that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.410
really makes them really
remarkable and special.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.970
Right?
They don&#39;t have

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.140
an extreme strength that
makes them an outlier.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.860
On the other side of that
the companies that have

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.365
the really extreme strengths
often have serious flaws.

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:17.240
And so one of the cautionary
lessons of venture capital

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.040
is, if you don&#39;t invest on
the basis of serious flaws.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.830
You don&#39;t invest in most of
the big winners, and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.820
we can go through example
after

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.570
example after example of
that.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.780
But that would have ruled
out almost all

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.240
the big winners over time.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.650
And so, at least what we
aspire to do is to invest in

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.340
the one, the startups that
have a really, really

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.630
extreme strength, along an
important dimension.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.730
And they&#39;d be willing to

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.750
tolerate some other,you
know, set of weaknesses.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.300
&gt;&gt; Ron, we got your slide
up.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, I don&#39;t want to
over dwell on the slide.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.140
But when you first meet an
investor,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.060
you&#39;ve got to be able to say
in one

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.200
compelling sentence that you
should practice like crazy.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.680
What your product does,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.780
so that the investor that
your talking to,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.316
immediately can picture the
product in their own mind.

00:05:05.316 --> 00:05:08.082
Probably 25% of the
entrepreneurs I

00:05:08.082 --> 00:05:11.349
talk to today still after
the first sentence,

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.950
I don&#39;t know what they do.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.640
And as I get older and less
patient, I say.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.380
Back up, I don&#39;t even know
what you do yet.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.760
But, so try and get that
perfect.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.370
And then I wanna skip to the
second column.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.000
You have to be decisive.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.860
The only way to make
progress is make decisions.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.760
Procrastination is the devil
in startups.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.950
So no matter what you do,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.740
you gotta keep that ship
moving.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.510
If it&#39;s decisions to hire,
decisions to fire.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.490
You&#39;ve gotta make those
quickly.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.170
All about building a great
team.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.090
Once you have a great
product, then it&#39;s all about

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.680
execution and building a
great team.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.660
&gt;&gt; Parker, could you talk
about your seed ground and

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.320
how that went, and

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.551
what you wish you had done
differently as a foundry,

00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.652
raising money?

00:06:02.652 --> 00:06:07.180
&gt;&gt; Sure, so actually I think

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.170
that my seed ground most of
the stuff with my current

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.980
company felt like, from a
fundraising perspective felt

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.300
like it came together
relatively quickly.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.677
But actually one of the
experiences I had,

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:20.383
I started a company before
this, that I was at for

00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:22.363
about six years and my
cofounder and

00:06:22.363 --> 00:06:25.465
I pitched almost every VC
firm in Silicon Valley,

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:28.237
we literally went to like 60
different firms and

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:29.840
they all told us no.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.300
And we were constantly
trying to figure out.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.740
You know, how do we, how
should we adjust our pitch?

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.910
And how should we do our
slides differently.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.830
And how do we Tweet the
story, and

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.370
that sort of thing.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.040
And at one point there was
this sort of

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.840
key insight that someone
gave me when I was pitching.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.455
Actually someone at Coastal
Ventures.

00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:47.830
And this VC said guys.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.740
You know, he was looking for

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.770
some very particular kind of
analysis that we

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.890
didn&#39;t have on hand.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.400
And he was like, guys, you
don&#39;t get it.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.510
He was like, you know,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.310
if you guys were the Twitter
guys,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.362
you guys could come in and
you could just be,

00:06:59.362 --> 00:07:01.950
like, and, like, put
whatever up here.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.130
And, like, we would invest
in you.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.830
But, like you guys aren&#39;t
the Twitter guys so

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.180
you need to make this really
easy and

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.820
have like all this stuff
ready for us and

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.000
all this kind of stuff.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.120
And I took like the exactly
opposite lesson of what,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.440
he, I think, wanted me to
take away from that, with.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.840
Which was like, jeez, like I
should really just

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.210
figure out a way to be the
Twitter guys.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.215
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m, like, that&#39;s, that&#39;s
the way to do this.

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:24.900
And so, actually like one of

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.040
the reasons I started my
current company.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.010
Or one of the things I found
very attractive about

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.410
Zenefits, is as I was
thinking about it.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.660
It seemed like a business.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.090
I was so frustrated from
this experience of

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.520
having tried, you know, for

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.090
like two years to raise
money from VC&#39;s.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.130
And then sort of decided
like to hell with it.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.830
You can&#39;t count on there
being

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.930
capital available to you.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.940
And so this,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.198
the business that I started
seemed like one that like,

00:07:48.198 --> 00:07:51.050
like actually just maybe I
could do it without raising

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.750
money at all.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.590
Like there might be a path
to kind of, you know,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.510
there was enough cash flow,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.770
it seemed compelling enough
that I could like, do that.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.030
And it turns out that those
are exactly the kinds of

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.850
businesses that investors
love to invest in.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.340
And it made it incredibly
easy.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.020
So I actually think like, I
mean, Sam&#39;s very kind and

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.070
said I was an expert
fundraiser.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.680
The reality is I don&#39;t
actually even think I&#39;m

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.820
very good at fundraising.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.450
It&#39;s probably something, I&#39;m
like less good at then,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.940
you know, sort of other
parts of my jobs.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.080
But I think if you can build
a business that&#39;s, you know,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.000
where everything&#39;s like
moving in

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.560
the right direction.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.450
If you can be like the
Twitter guys,

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.910
like nothing else matters
and if you can&#39;t like,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.030
you know, be the Twitter
guys it&#39;s very hard for

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.680
anything else to make a
difference.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.420
For things to kind of come
together for you.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.540
&gt;&gt; Why did that VC say be
like the Twitter guys when

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.550
the fail wail dominated the
site for two years.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.330
&gt;&gt; Cause it worked.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.274
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The other point I want to

00:08:50.274 --> 00:08:55.744
make is, bootstrap as long
as you possibly can.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:09:01.322
I met with one of the best
founders in tech.

00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:03.366
Who&#39;s starting a new company
and

00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:07.180
I said to her when when are
you going to raise money?

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.740
I might not.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.490
And I go that is awesome.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.750
You know never forget the
bootstrap.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.140
&gt;&gt; So I was actually going
to close on this but

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.790
i&#39;m just going to accelerate
it cause Parker I think just

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.463
gave you the most important
thing you&#39;ll ever hear.

00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:23.223
Which is also what I was
going to say.

00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:26.541
Which is, so, the number one
piece of advice that

00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:27.670
I&#39;ve ever read and

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.860
that I tell people on these
kinds of topics is always.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.300
It&#39;s from the comedian Steve
Martin, who I think is

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.160
an absolute genius, wrote a
great book on his startup

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.190
career which obviously was
very successful.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.340
The book is called, Born
Standing Up, and he,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.750
literally, it&#39;s a short
little book and

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.630
it describes how he became
Steve Martin.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.930
And the part of the book is,
he says, you know,

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:45.630
what is the key to success,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.940
he says the key to success
is be so

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.810
good they can&#39;t ignore you.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.390
Right, and so in a sense,
like all this,

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.080
we&#39;re gonna have this entire
conversation though, which

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.520
I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll keep having
about how to raise money,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.960
but in a sense it&#39;s all kind
of beside the point.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.360
Because if you do what
Parker&#39;s done and

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.270
you build a business that is
going to be a gigantic

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.150
success then investors are
throwing money at you.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.940
And if you come in, you
know, with a theory and

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.570
a plan and no data and
you&#39;re just one of,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.100
you know, the next thousand.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.686
It&#39;s gonna be far, far
harder to raise money.

00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:12.750
The other, so that&#39;s the
positive way to put it,

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.990
is kind of be so good they
can&#39;t ignore you.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.580
In other words, you&#39;re
almost always better off

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.620
making your business better
than you

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.450
are making your pitch
better.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.640
The other thing,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.100
that&#39;s the positive way of
looking at it.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.050
The negative way of looking
at it,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.750
or the cautionary lesson, is
that this gets me in

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.050
trouble every single time I
say it but

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.370
I&#39;m on a ton of flu
medications so

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.530
I&#39;m going to go ahead,.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.320
And just let it rip.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:31.590
Raising venture capital is

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.870
the easiest thing a startup
founder is ever going to do.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.190
As compared to recruiting,
right?

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.540
As compared to recruiting
engineers.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.900
In particular as compared to

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.050
recruiting engineer number
20.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.725
It&#39;s far harder than raising
venture capital.

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:46.300
Selling to enterprise
customers is harder.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.180
Getting viral growth going
on a consumer business is

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.970
harder, getting advertising
revenue is harder,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.520
almost everything you&#39;ll
ever do is

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.880
harder than raising venture
capital.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.460
And so, I think Parker is
exactly right.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.061
If you get in a situation in
which raising the money is

00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:02.488
hard, it&#39;s probably not hard
compared to

00:11:02.488 --> 00:11:04.760
all the other stuff that&#39;s
about to follow.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.720
And it&#39;s very important to
bear that in mind.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.230
You know, it&#39;s often said
that raising money is not

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.670
actually a success, it&#39;s not
actually a milestone.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.880
For a company and I think
that&#39;s true and

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.330
I think that&#39;s the
underlying reason.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.280
It just, it puts you in a
position to be able to do

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.350
all the other, harder
things.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.647
&gt;&gt; Related to that, what do
you guys wish foundry&#39;s did

00:11:22.647 --> 00:11:25.460
differently, when raising
the money and.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.039
You know, you mentioned this
relationship between money

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:30.401
and and how that applies
here so

00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:31.333
maybe we could start with
that.

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:33.295
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the single
biggest thing that people

00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:36.060
are just missingand I think
it&#39;s all of our faults.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.880
We&#39;re all not talking about
it enough but I think

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.050
the single biggest thing
entrepreneurs are missing

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.000
both on fundraising and how
they run their companies is

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.880
the relationship between
risk and cash.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.980
So the relationship between
risk and raising cash and

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.870
then the relationship with
risk and spending cash.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.690
So I&#39;ve always been a fan of
something that Andy

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.930
Radcliffe taught me years
ago which he called the,

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.540
it&#39;s called the Onion Theory
of Risk which basically is

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.820
you can think about a
startup like on day one

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.740
as having every conceivable
kind of risk right?

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.830
And you can basically just
make a list of the risks.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.670
So you&#39;ve got, you know,

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.360
founding team risk, you
know, do the founders,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.860
are the founders gonna be
able to work together?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.740
Do you have the right
founders?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.160
You&#39;re gonna have product
risk, you know,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.340
can you build a product?

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.510
You&#39;ll have technical risk,
right?

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.630
Which is maybe you need a
machine

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.220
learning breakthrough or
something to make it work.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.110
How are you going to be able
to do that?

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.930
You&#39;ll have you know, launch
risk.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.720
Will the launch go well?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.050
You&#39;ll have, you know,
market acceptance risk.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.420
You&#39;ll have revenue risk.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.830
A big risk you get into in a
lot of businesses that have

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.290
a sales force is can you
actually sell the product

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.070
for enough money to actually
pay for the cost of sale.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.199
So you have cost of sale
risk.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.810
If your consumer product
you&#39;ll have

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.340
viral growth risk.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.400
Well you get the thinner
viral growth.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.120
And so, I&#39;ll start up at the
very beginning.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.220
Is basically just this long,
this long list of risks.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.570
Right, and then, the way I
always think about running

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.320
a start up is also the way I
think about raising money,

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.580
which is a process of

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.050
peeling away layers of risk
as you go, right.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.560
And so you raise seed money,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.190
in order to peel away the
first two or

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.100
three risks, right.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.050
The founding team risk, the
product risk.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.620
Maybe the initial watch
risk.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.970
You raise the a round to
peel away the next level of

00:12:58.970 --> 00:12:59.750
product risk.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.265
Maybe you appeal away some
recruiting risk,

00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:02.610
&#39;cuz you get your full
engineering team built.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.440
And maybe you peel away some
customer risk,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.690
cuz you get your first phi
beta customers, right?

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.430
And so, basically, the way
to think about it,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.570
is, you&#39;re peeling away
risk, as you go.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.330
You&#39;re peeling away risk by
achieving milestones.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.710
And then, as you achieve
milestones,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.430
you&#39;re both making progress
in your business.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.310
And you&#39;re justifying
raising more capital, right?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.850
And so you come in and you
pitch somebody like us.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.990
And you say you&#39;re raising
your B round.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.890
You know, the best way to do
that with us is you

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.280
say okay, I raised the seed
round.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.930
I achieved these milestones,
I eliminated these risks.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:28.790
I raised the A round,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.120
I achieved these milestones,
I eliminated these risks.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.030
Now I&#39;m gonna raise a B
round.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.930
Here are milestones.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.720
Here are my risks.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.440
And then by the time a go to
raise the seed round,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.080
here&#39;s the, here&#39;s the state
that I&#39;ll be in.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.180
And then you calibrate the
amount of

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.710
money that you&#39;ve raised to
spend to

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.905
the risks that you&#39;re
pulling out of the business.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:43.940
And I go through all this,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.490
in a sense this sounds kind
of obvious, but

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.340
I go through all this cuz
it&#39;s a systematic way to

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.510
think about how the money
gets raised and deployed.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.390
As compared to so

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.930
much of what&#39;s happening
especially these days.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.470
Which is just oh my god let
me go raise as

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.930
much money as I can, let me
go build the fancy offices,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.630
let me go hire as many
people as I can and

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.000
just kind of hope for the
best.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.560
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m gonna be tactical.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:07.870
For sure don&#39;t ask people to
sign an NDA.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.540
We rarely get asked anymore
because most founders have

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.670
figured out.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:14.970
That if you ask somebody for

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.590
an NDA at the front end of
the relationship,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.850
your basically saying, I
don&#39;t trust you.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.660
So the relationship between
investors and

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.300
founders involves lots of
trust.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.240
The biggest mistake that I
see by far.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.900
Is not getting things in
writing.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.620
You know the, my advice on
the fund raising process is

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.700
do it as quickly and

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.940
as efficiently as you
possibly can,

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.770
don&#39;t obsess over it.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.990
For some reason, founders
get their ego involved in

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.890
fundraising, where it&#39;s a
personal victory.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.480
It is the tiniest step on
the way, as Mark said.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.964
And it&#39;s, it&#39;s the most
fundamental.

00:14:54.964 --> 00:14:57.007
Hurry up and get it over
with.

00:14:57.007 --> 00:14:58.403
But in the process when

00:14:58.403 --> 00:15:00.687
somebody makes a commitment
to you.

00:15:00.687 --> 00:15:03.886
You get in your car and you
type an email to

00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:08.050
them that confirms what they
just said to you.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.120
Because investors have, a
lot of investors have

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.310
very short memories and they
forget that they committed

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.350
to you that they were going
to finance.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.730
Or they forget what the
valuation was, or

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.340
that they were going to find
a co-investor.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.340
You can get rid of all that
controversy just by putting

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.190
it in writing, and when they
try and

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.220
get out of it you just
resend the email and

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.380
say, excuse me and

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.650
hopefully they&#39;ve replied to
that email anyway.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.170
So get it in writing.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.330
In meetings take notes and,
and

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.879
follow up on what&#39;s
important.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.450
&gt;&gt; I want to talk a little
bit more about tactics here.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.600
Just how does the process
go?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.300
Can people email you guys
directly?

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.570
Do they need to get an
introduction?

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.840
How many meetings does it
take for

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.800
you to make a decision?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.050
How do you figure out what
the right terms are?

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.320
When can a founder ask you
for a check?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.380
&gt;&gt; Do you wanna?

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.890
That was about it.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.940
That was like six questions.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.690
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s a lot of things.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, good.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.670
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the process.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.112
&gt;&gt; Why don&#39;t you describe,
why don&#39;t you describe,

00:16:04.112 --> 00:16:05.495
cuz you&#39;ll describe seed
then I&#39;ll describe.

00:16:05.495 --> 00:16:06.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.
So yeah.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.310
So, SV Angel, you know,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.420
invests in seed stages
start-ups.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.810
So we like to be the very
first investor.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.530
We normally invest today at
around that&#39;s a million to

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:19.340
two million.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.330
It used to only be a
million.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.520
So if we invest 250k that
means there&#39;s five or

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.780
six other investors in that
syndicate.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.140
SV Angel has now a staff of
13 people.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.500
I do no due diligence
anymore.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.720
I am not a picker anymore.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.230
I just help on major
projects for

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.540
the portfolio companies that
are starting to mature.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.030
But we have a whole team
that processes.

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:53.260
We at SV Angel end up
investing in one company for

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.280
every 30 that we look at,
and

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.810
we end up investing in about
one a week.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.060
I think what&#39;s interesting
is we don&#39;t really take

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.560
anything over the transom.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.740
Our network is so huge now
that we basically just take

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.830
leads from our own network.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.440
We evaluate the opportunity
which means you have to

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.250
send in a really great short
executive summary.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.740
And if we like that we
actually vote,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.090
although I&#39;m not in this
meeting anymore, but

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.650
the group actually votes on
do we make a phone call.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.870
That&#39;s how important time is
in this process.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.130
And if enough of the team at
SV thinks it&#39;s

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.190
interesting, then they
appoint a person to

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.710
make a phone call to that
founder,

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.050
usually somebody on our team
who has domain experience.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.700
If the phone call goes well,
bingo, we want to meet you.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.740
If SV Angel asks you for

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.980
a meeting we are well on our
way to investing.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.299
If that meeting goes well,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.660
we&#39;ll do some background
checks.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.150
Backdoor background checks.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.960
Get a good feeling about the
company.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.540
The market that they&#39;re
going after.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.150
And then, and then make the
commitment to invest.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.330
And then start, start
helping get other value add

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.660
investors to be part of the
syndicate.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.490
Because if we&#39;re gonna have

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.720
an equal workload we want
the other investors in

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.870
this company to be great
angel investors as well.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.790
&gt;&gt; So I&#39;ll talk a little bit
about the venture stage and

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:32.680
the series A stage, you
know, the problems.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.460
So to start with, I think
it&#39;s fair to say at

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.910
the point that all that top
tier venture capitalist

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.840
pretty much only invest in
two kinds of companies.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.860
At the series A stage.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.390
One is if

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.750
they have previously raised
a seed round.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.450
And so, it&#39;s, it&#39;s almost
always case when were doing

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.565
a series A investment and
the company has a million or

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:51.010
$2 million in seed
financing.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.300
You know from, from Ron and,
and

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.419
folks that he likes to work
with.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.200
Almost always by the way Ron
just to be clear.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.000
And folks he likes to work
with.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.850
So first either they have a
seed round.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.800
So if you&#39;re going to raise
serious aid

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.245
the first thing to do is
raise seed.

00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:07.650
Cuz that&#39;s generally the way
the progression works at

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.715
this, at this point.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.390
Every once in a while we&#39;ll
go straight to a on

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.540
a on a company that hasn&#39;t
raised the seed rounds.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.830
Really the only times though
that,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.320
that happens are when it&#39;s a
founder who has

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.840
been a successful founder in
the past, and is almost

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.740
certainly somebody we&#39;ve
worked with in the past.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.230
So actually we have an
announcement we just,

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.750
we just one of these we&#39;ll
announce in a few weeks.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.950
Where it&#39;s founder who I was
an angel investor,

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.950
actually I think Ryan was
also in the team&#39;s

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.270
company in 2006.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.740
And then the company did its
thing and

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.110
ultimately was acquired
another big company.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.020
And then that team now is,
is starting their new thing.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.880
So, in that case, we&#39;re just
gonna jump straight to

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.000
an A cuz they&#39;re so, they&#39;re
so well-known and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.190
they have have a plan all
lined up for it.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.600
But, you know, that, that&#39;s
the exception.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.540
It&#39;s almost always
proceeded,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.470
proceeded by a seed round.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.650
The other thing is yeah I

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.220
guess I mentioned this
already, but we, we,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.150
get, similar to what Ron
said, we get 2000 referrals

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.550
a year through our referral
network.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.610
A very large percentage of

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.320
those are referrals through
the seed investors.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.730
And so, by far, the best way
to get to, the, the,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.620
by far the best way to get
investor introductions to

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.080
the A stage investor firms
is to be able,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.785
is to work through the seed
investors.

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:12.977
Or to work through something
like

00:20:14.004 --> 00:20:15.770
&gt;&gt; Speaking about terms.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.890
what, what terms should
founders care most about?

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.350
And how should founders
negotiate?

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.620
Maybe Parker, we&#39;ll start
with you on this one.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.190
&gt;&gt; Sure.
Well I think

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.490
probably precisely because
of what Mark said.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.860
The most important thing at
the seed stage is picking

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.560
the right seed investors,
because they&#39;re gonna sort

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.910
of lay the foundation for
future fundraising events.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.260
You know, they&#39;re gonna make
the right introductions.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:36.820
And I think there&#39;s a,

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.370
an enormous difference in
the quality of,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.230
of an introduction.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.650
So if you can get a really
good introduction from

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.900
someone who a venture
capitalist really trusts and

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.500
respects, you know, the
likelihood that, that&#39;s

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.820
gonna go well is so much
higher than sort of like a,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.650
you know, a much, kind of a
much, a much more lukewarm

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.060
introduction from someone
they don&#39;t know as well.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.770
So the seed stage, probably
the best thing you can

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:00.610
do is find the right
investors.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.161
And then
&gt;&gt; How,

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:03.469
how does the founder know
who the right investors are?

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:05.850
Well I think it&#39;s really
hard.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.430
I mean so one of the best
ways, I mean, you know,

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.970
not to give a plug for YC
but you know,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.080
YC does a really good job
telling you exactly who they

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.090
think those people are.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.110
And and can really direct
you towards a,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.720
and I&#39;ve actually have found
it

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.400
to be like pretty accurate
in terms of like who you

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.310
guys said were going to be
the best people like.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.080
They ended up being the most
helpful as we were

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.710
raising subsequent rounds.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.570
Sort of, you know,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.000
really providing the best
introductions.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.950
And the people who maybe I
thought were, you know,

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.410
seemed okay, but were not,
you know, like,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.470
we&#39;re not as, sort of,
highly rated by YC.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.500
Like, they, that ended up
being the case that they

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.690
were, kind of, like, real
duds, in the seed round.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.630
&gt;&gt; Someday we&#39;re gonna
publish our

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.790
list of these people.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.200
&gt;&gt; Oh my god there are going
to

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.410
be a lot of upset people
when you do.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.840
&gt;&gt; So, how, how do you think
about negotiation?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.096
How do you figure out what
the right evaluation for

00:21:53.096 --> 00:21:54.740
a company is and what are
the terms?

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.600
&gt;&gt; Well so I started out.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.590
I mean like when I was
raising my seed around I

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.410
really didn&#39;t know.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.160
And, and I mean we had
conversations about this.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.490
I probably started a little
too high on

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:04.360
the valuation side.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.350
And the, so as you guys
know, like Y company sort of

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.120
culminates in this thing
called demo day,

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.000
where you can get sort of
all of these investors at

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.590
once, who are looking at the
company.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.217
And I started out trying to
raise money at like a $12 or

00:22:18.217 --> 00:22:21.170
a $15 million dollar.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.480
Which is like not quite the
same thing as a valuation,

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.210
but sort of rough, rough,
roughly equivalent.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.330
And everyone was like,
that&#39;s crazy.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.290
You know, that&#39;s, that&#39;s
completely nuts.

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.920
They&#39;re, like, you&#39;re, like,
too big for

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.620
your britches, like,

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.950
that, that&#39;s completely,
just wouldn&#39;t work.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.670
And so I ended up sort of
walking it down a little bit

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:39.440
and, and within, sort of the
space of a couple

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.110
days said okay, well I&#39;m
gonna raise at nine.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:44.140
And then suddenly, for
whatever reason that had

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.920
sort of hit some magical
threshold on the seed,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.590
seed stage, that it was
below 10.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.690
It seemed like there was
like,

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.900
almost infinite demand, for
the round at a,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.160
at a like, at a 9 million
cap.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.885
So no-one would pay 12 but
at a $9 million cap it felt

00:22:56.885 --> 00:22:58.703
like I probably could have
raised like,

00:22:58.703 --> 00:23:00.190
ten million dollars.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.030
And the, the round came
together you know,

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.500
in, in, in roughly about a
week.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.300
At that point once I kind a
hit that threshold.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.070
And so there seemed to be,

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.690
and they probably fluctuate
over time, but

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.960
there seem to be these sort
of, like, thresholds,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.740
particularly for seed-stage
companies, that, that,

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.170
that investors will think of
as, like, this is what,

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.100
you know, like, above this
level is like, crazy.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.700
That, like, doesn&#39;t matter.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.410
And there&#39;s sort of like a
rough kinda range that

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.410
that people are willing to
pay.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.690
And so, you just kinda like,
you, you,

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.010
you just have to kinda
figure out what that is.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.210
Get the money that you need.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.940
Don&#39;t, don&#39;t raise any more
than you need and,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.600
and, and just kinda get it
done.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.390
And you know, at the end of
the day like, whether,

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.470
whether you raise a 12 or
nine or like six, it&#39;s not,

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.090
it&#39;s not a huge deal for the
rest of the company.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.039
&gt;&gt; Is there a maximum amount
of the company you think

00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:49.555
the founders should sell in
their seed round era?

00:23:49.555 --> 00:23:53.860
Beyond which, problems for
any of you.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.600
&gt;&gt; I feel like that&#39;s a
better question for you.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.460
&gt;&gt; Well, gosh, I don&#39;t know.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.890
I mean, you know?

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.900
I think, On, on, I mean, I
don&#39;t,

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.460
I don&#39;t know the rules on
this stuff.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.120
I think the, the tricky
thing, is, is, I mean,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.110
it seems like they were kind
of rough.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.330
Particularly for, like, a
series A you&#39;re probably

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.980
gonna sell somewhere
between, you know, 20 and

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.280
30% of the company because
you know,

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.188
below, venture capitalists
tend to be a lot more

00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:23.620
ownership-focused than
price-focused.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.430
So you might find that it&#39;s
actually,

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:28.170
sometimes when companies
raise really big rounds.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.502
It&#39;s because, you know, the
investor basically said

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.636
listen I&#39;m not gonna go
below 20% ownership but

00:24:32.636 --> 00:24:33.920
I&#39;ll pay more for it.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.200
And so, and, and above 30%
probably sort of

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.650
weird things happen to the
cap table.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.060
Like it gets hard, you know,
down the line to sort of,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.130
you know, for

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.730
there to be enough room on
the cap table for everyone.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.890
And so everything seems to
come in at that range.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:53.480
So that probably just is
what it is, in most cases.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.930
So, at, you know, at the
seed stage.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:55.640
I mean, what I&#39;ve heard.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.410
There doesn&#39;t seem to me any
magic to it.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.010
But it seems like ten to
15%,

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.590
is what, what people say.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.630
But what, that&#39;s mostly just
what I&#39;ve heard.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.180
I&#39;m curious at your guy&#39;s
thoughts.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, I agree with all
that.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.090
I think it&#39;s important to
get the process over with.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.000
But I think it&#39;s important
for the founder to say to

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.910
themselves in the beginning,
at, at what point does

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:26.770
my ownership start to
de-motivate me?

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.190
Because it there&#39;s like a
40% dilution

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.950
in an angel round.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.060
I&#39;ve actually said to the
founder,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.600
do you realize you&#39;ve
already doomed yourself.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.270
You know, you, you&#39;re gonna
own less than 5%

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.540
of this company if you&#39;re a
normal company.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.476
And so, these guidelines are
important.

00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:50.770
The, the, you know, the, the
10 to 15%,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.570
because if you keep giving
away more than that,

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.300
there&#39;s not enough left for
you and

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.570
the team, and you&#39;re the
ones doing all the work.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:59.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.280
&gt;&gt; Well actually, we&#39;ll
walk, we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve seen a,

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.780
we&#39;ve seen a series of
interesting companies in

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.470
the last five years that,
where they just, you,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.540
we just walk, oh, simply, we
won&#39;t, we won&#39;t bid.

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.170
Sometimes the basis of

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.920
the cap table&#39;s already
destroyed.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.750
Outside investors already
own too much.

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.170
There&#39;s a company we really
wanted to invest in but

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.960
the outside investors
already owned 80% of

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.270
it when we, when we talked
to them.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.570
And it was still a
relatively young company.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.510
They had just done two early
rounds that had

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.350
just sold too much of the
company.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.130
And literally we were
worried, and

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.960
I think accurately so,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.140
that it was gonna be
demotivating for

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.720
that team to have that
structure.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.444
&gt;&gt; One more question for

00:26:29.444 --> 00:26:31.300
you before we open up to the
audience.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.020
for, for Ron and Clark.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.740
Could you guys both tell the
story of the most successful

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.130
investment you ever made and
how that came to happen?

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.860
&gt;&gt; Other than Zenefits of
course.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, other than
Zenefits.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah other than Zenefits.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.070
That&#39;s gonna be hard.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.230
For me clearly it

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.490
was the investment in Google
in 1999.

00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:58.270
&gt;&gt; And we got we got Google
return out of it.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.830
But funny enough I met

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.770
Google through a Standford
professor David Cheriton.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.830
Who was in the school of
engineering.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.580
He&#39;s still here.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.990
He was actually an angel
investor in Google.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.730
And an investor in our fund,
and

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.950
kind of the quid pro quo we
have with our investors in

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.640
the fund is you have to tell
us

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.010
about any interesting
companies that you see.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.390
And we loved it the day that
Jared was an investor in

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.170
our fund because he had
access to

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.980
the computer science
department&#39;s deal flow.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.220
And we were at this party at
the of DFA&#39;s house in

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.490
full tuxedo.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.230
I hate tuxedos.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.760
And day, have you, anyone
here know David Sheraton?

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.260
Cuz you know for sure he
does not like tuxedos, and

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.430
he was in a tuxedo.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.210
But I went up to him and

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.030
we complained about our
attire and then I said, hey,

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.680
what&#39;s happening in, at
Stanford?

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.470
And he says, well there&#39;s
this project called Backrub.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.140
And it&#39;s search, and

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.790
it&#39;s search by page rank and
relevancy.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.720
And back in, today page rank
and relevancy,

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.510
everyone says, oh, you know,
that&#39;s so obvious.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.860
In 1998, that was not
obvious that engineers were

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:15.370
designing a product based on
this thing called page rank.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.630
And all it was was a simple
algorithm that said,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.590
if a lot of people go to
that website and

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.610
other websites direct them
there,

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.970
there must be something good
happening on that website.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.520
That was the original
algorithm.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.340
And the, the motivation was
relevance.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.770
So I said to David, I have
to meet these people.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.630
And he said, you can&#39;t meet
them till they&#39;re ready.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.069
Which was the following May
funny enough.

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:42.149
&gt;&gt; I waited.
I called them

00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:44.280
every month for five months.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.270
And finally got my audition
with Larry and Sergei.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.860
And right away they were
very strategic.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.490
They said, we&#39;ll let you
invest if you can

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.660
get sequoia.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.340
We don&#39;t know sequoia but
they&#39;re investors in Yahoo!

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.820
and because we&#39;re late to
market we want to

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.560
know we have a deal with
Yahoo!

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.960
And, and so

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.749
I earned my way into the
investment in Google.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.860
How about you?
&gt;&gt; So,

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.540
I was talking about on the
other side which is,

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.540
which is Airbnb.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.950
Which we actually were not
early investors in.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.120
We were, we did an, Airbnb
as growth round.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.470
We did the first big growth
round at Airbnb.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.450
yeah.
At about a billion dollar

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.250
valuation in to 2011.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.530
And I think that will turn
out to be,

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.493
I believe that will turn out
to be one of the spectacular

00:29:27.493 --> 00:29:29.174
growth investments of all
time, we&#39;ll see.

00:29:29.174 --> 00:29:32.389
But I think it&#39;s gonna be
one of the big companies.

00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:34.099
So I tell that story because
it&#39;s,

00:29:34.099 --> 00:29:36.170
it&#39;s not a story of pure
genius.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.870
It&#39;s a we, we passed, we
didn&#39;t even met with them,

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.180
I don&#39;t think we met with
them the first time around,

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.910
or maybe one of our junior
people did.

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:43.170
But it was one of these,
it&#39;s you know,

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.850
I said earlier that venture
capital is

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.440
entirely a game of outliers,
right?

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.025
One of the key things with
outliers is

00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:50.081
the ideas often seem
completely nuts up front.

00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:52.332
And so, of course, the idea
of a website where you can

00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:54.582
have other people stay in
your house, if you just like

00:29:54.582 --> 00:29:56.682
made a list of the ideas
that are like, most nuts,

00:29:56.682 --> 00:29:58.557
that would be like, right
there at the top.

00:29:58.557 --> 00:29:59.418
And then.

00:29:59.418 --> 00:30:01.697
&gt;&gt; I have a very nice e-mail
from you

00:30:01.697 --> 00:30:02.470
&gt;&gt; Good, good.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.769
I was hoping I was very
courteous in my stupidity.

00:30:05.769 --> 00:30:07.154
Well the second most stupid
idea you

00:30:07.154 --> 00:30:08.170
could possibly think of is

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.350
a website where you can stay
in other people&#39;s houses.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.720
And so that the

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.529
&gt;&gt; Uniquely combines both of
those bad ideas.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.690
&gt;&gt; So, of course, it turns
out they&#39;ve unlocked

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.166
an entirely new way to
basically, sell real estate.

00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:22.930
They&#39;ve unlocked this just
gigantic number of

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:23.960
gigantic global phenomenon.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.300
It&#39;s gonna be an enormously
successful company.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.290
So part was just coming to
grips with the fact that we

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:30.710
had whiffed on our initial
analysis of the idea.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.460
And that the numbers were

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.080
clearly proving that we were
wrong.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.720
And the customer behavior
was clearly

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.880
proving that we were wrong.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.748
So one of our philosophies
at our firm is

00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:39.000
that we&#39;re multistage.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.920
A big reason for that is so

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.040
we can fix our mistakes and
we can pay up to get in

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.140
later when we screw up early
on.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.220
The other thing i&#39;ll
highlight though

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.770
is the other reason why we
pull the trigger at

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.480
a high evaluation, when we
did was because of our,

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.810
we had spent time at the
point with the founders.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.210
With Brian and with Joe and
Nate and there&#39;s a friend of

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.750
mine in private equity has
this great line,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.058
Egon Durban has this great
line.

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:01.930
He says when people progress
through their careers,

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:02.940
they get bigger and bigger
jobs, and

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.450
at some point they get the
really big job.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.240
And it&#39;s,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.610
some people, half people
grow into the big job, and

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.380
about the other half of
people swell into it.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.920
Right?
And you can

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.200
kinda tell the difference.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.510
There&#39;s a point where people
just lose their minds.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.770
And one of the issues with
these companies that

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.860
are sort of super successful
hyper growth companies is

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:21.960
you know, this would be the
sorta the classic case.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.910
These super young founders
who

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.290
haven&#39;t run anything before,
so how are they gonna be at

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.030
running this sorta giant
global operation, and

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.770
we just were tremendously
impressed and our, today,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:33.030
every time we deal with all
three of those guys.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.940
How mature they are, how
much they are progressing.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.620
You know, it, it&#39;s like they
get more and

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.500
more mature, they get better
and better adjustment and

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.940
they get more and more
humble as they grow.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.590
And so that made us feel
really good.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.310
That not just was this
business gonna grow, but

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.430
that these were guys who
were gonna be

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.430
able to build something.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.420
And be able to run it in a
really good way.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.350
&gt;&gt; You know, people always
ask me.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.460
Why do you think Airbnb is
such a great company.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.330
It&#39;s funny we&#39;re obsessing
over Airbnb but and

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.620
I say to people it&#39;s because
all three founders are as

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.280
good as the other founder.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.180
That is very rare.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.120
In the case of Google.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.960
Two founders,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.605
one of them is a little
better than the other one.

00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:15.180
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER}

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.900
&gt;&gt; Hey, he is the CEO every
company has a CEO.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.620
&gt;&gt; I think we just got the
tech crunch headline.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.040
&gt;&gt; Every company, every
company has a CEO.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.010
Why am I saying this?

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.410
&gt;&gt; When you start a company,

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:35.050
you have to go find somebody
as good or better than you.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.524
To be the cofounder.

00:32:36.524 --> 00:32:38.300
If you do that,

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.710
your chances of success grow
astronomically.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.570
And that&#39;s why Airbnb became
so successful, so quickly.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.470
The anomaly is Mark
Zuckerberg at Facebook.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:53.690
Yes, he has an awesome team.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.000
But the Mark Zuckerberg
phenomenon where it&#39;s

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.045
mainly one person, that is
the outlier.

00:33:00.045 --> 00:33:01.380
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.930
&gt;&gt; So when you start a
company you have got to find

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.370
phenomenal co-founders.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.080
&gt;&gt; All right.
Audience questions.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.060
Yes.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.140
&gt;&gt; So obviously the
conventional wisdom about

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.000
why you raise money is
because you need it.

00:33:16.264 --> 00:33:19.252
But the more I get off
conventional wisdom the more

00:33:19.252 --> 00:33:22.171
I&#39;m starting to hear another
story about why you

00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:25.589
raise money and I&quot;m actually
hearing founders say it&#39;s

00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:28.720
more to facilitate the big
exit, or in the worst case

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.170
to facilitate the acqui hire
that are just fizzling out.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.190
What extent is that accurate
thinking or

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.596
&gt;&gt; Does raising money help

00:33:36.596 --> 00:33:38.710
you with an exit, or an
acqui hire?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.190
&gt;&gt; Well if you,

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:45.680
if you pick good investors
who have good Rolodexes and

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.259
domain expertise in what
your company does.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.010
They&#39;re gonna add a lot more
value than the money.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.110
And those are the types of
investors you should be

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.720
looking for.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So the answer to

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.410
the question is clearly yes.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.810
But also in a sense it
doesn&#39;t matter.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.280
Cuz you can&#39;t plan these
things according to

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.210
the downside.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.880
And so.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.510
I mean, that&#39;s the scenario
you are not

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.520
are obviously not hoping
for.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.030
And so while the answer is
yes.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.140
Probably that shouldn&#39;t
enter into

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.560
the decision making process.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.660
Too much, but it might enter
into which investor to

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.360
raise money from,

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.770
it probably doesn&#39;t enter
into the whether to

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.720
raise money question that
much I don&#39;t think.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.170
&gt;&gt; I intend to start a
business,

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.240
just grow the capital
investment,

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.260
I do want to end up with
some equity.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.850
Do you guys have any advice
about how to

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.470
deal with extra amounts,
people are taking so

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.760
long, not everything is like
software.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.640
It&#39;s viral.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.340
What should congress do for

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:40.520
capital investment companies
&gt;&gt; So this is,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.170
I would double down on my
previous comments on

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.910
the onion theory of risk and
the staging of risk in cash

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:48.930
which is the more capital
has in the business the more

00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.010
intense and serious you have
to be about exactly what&#39;s

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:52.510
going to be required to make
the business work and

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.350
what the staging of
milestones and risks are.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:56.660
Cuz in that case, you wanna
line up,

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.700
you wanna be very precise of
lining up.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.900
Because the risk is so

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.070
high that it&#39;ll all go
sideways right?

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.120
So, like, you wanna be very
precise what you&#39;re

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.320
gonna accomplish with your A
round.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:04.950
And what&#39;s going to be

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.280
a successful execution of
the A round.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.520
Because if you raise too
much money in the A round,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.150
that&#39;ll seriously screw you
up, right,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.920
later on down the road.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.480
In the, cuz you know you&#39;re
gonna raise the C,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.400
D, E rounds.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.830
You know, and then the
cumulative,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.560
dilution will get to be,
will get to be too much.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.960
And so you have to be
precise on

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:18.860
every single round.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.060
You have to raise as close
to the exact right amount of

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.360
money as possible and then
you have to be as pure and

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.860
clean and, and precise with
the investors as you

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.460
can possibly be about the
risks and the milestones.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.120
But, this by the way is a
big thing.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.720
This is actually, I&#39;m really
glad you asked the question.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.250
It kind of goes back to what
Parker said.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.820
Like, look if you walk into
our firm and

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.250
you&#39;ve got Twitter, or
you&#39;ve got Pinterest,

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.820
you&#39;ve got something and
it&#39;s just viral growth and

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.770
it&#39;s just on fire and it&#39;s
just gonna go.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.960
Like, those are the easy
ones.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.150
Like it&#39;s just, like, let&#39;s
put money in it.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.890
And let&#39;s just feed the
beast and off it goes.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:47.670
But if you walk in and

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.170
you&#39;re like, I got this
really great idea.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:50.880
But it&#39;s gonna take $300
million,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.270
staged out over the next
five years.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.670
Probably across five rounds.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.650
You know, It has

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:55.790
a potentially very big
outcome.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:57.760
But boy, like this is not
Twitter.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.710
Like, this is gonna be
serious heavy lifting.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:00.880
To be able to get there.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.940
We will still do those but
the operational excellence

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.620
of the part of the team
matters a lot more.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.310
And one of the ways that you
can convey the operational

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.465
excellence is in the quality
of the plant.

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:14.370
And back to the Steve Martin
thing be so

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.490
good they can&#39;t ignore you.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:16.670
The plans should be very
precise.

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.580
&gt;&gt; And there are ways if
your capital equipment.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.230
Intensive.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.560
There are ways of borrowing
money in addition to

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.270
venture capital.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:27.938
&gt;&gt; You, you can kick in.

00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:29.050
You can kick on a venture
data and

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.070
then later on lease
financing.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:31.792
But again that underlines
the need for operational

00:36:31.792 --> 00:36:33.755
excellence because if you&#39;re
gonna raise debt, then you

00:36:33.755 --> 00:36:35.478
really need to be precise in
how you&#39;re running the

00:36:35.478 --> 00:36:37.321
company because it&#39;s very
easy to trip the convenance

00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:39.820
on a loan and it&#39;s very easy
to lose the company.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.340
And so it&#39;s a thread the
needle progress that

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.170
demands a just sort of a
more advanced level of

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.280
management then sort of, you
know, the next SnapChat.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.670
&gt;&gt; What are some bad sides
for

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.130
investors that you shouldn&#39;t
work with their company?

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah that&#39;s a good
question.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.420
How do you know with an,
what&#39;s a sign that you

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.079
should avoid a particular
investor?

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.800
&gt;&gt; Well, it&#39;s the inverse of
what I

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.570
said about a good investor.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:07.650
If it&#39;s an investor who has
no domain expertise in your

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.650
company, does not have a
Rolodex where they can

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.920
help you with introductions.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.040
Both for business
development and

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.130
in helping you do the
intro&#39;s for series a.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.440
And you should not take that
person&#39;s money,

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.290
especially if they&#39;re in it
just to make money and you

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.030
can suss those people out,
you know, pretty quickly.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah I would, glad you
asked that question.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.980
Bring up sort of a broader
point which is

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.690
If your company is
successful.

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:36.730
You know, we&#39;re talking
about our,

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.510
you know, I think,

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.220
generally, or at least as a
company, is we want,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.829
our investors are the ones
that wanna build big,

00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:42.180
independent franchise
companies.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.170
So we&#39;re talking about a 10
or 15 or 20 year journey.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.760
You know, 10 or 15 or 20
years you may

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.590
notice is longer than the
average American marriage.

00:37:51.127 --> 00:37:53.520
&gt;&gt; This is significant.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.930
The choice of key investors,
of particular investors who

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:57.460
are gonna be on the board
for a company, I think,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.180
is just as important as who
you get married to,

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.259
which is extremely
important.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:02.940
These are people you&#39;re
gonna be living with, and

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.690
partnering with and

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.770
relying on, and dealing with
in position, you know,

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:08.460
in conditions of great
stress and

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.420
anxiety for a long period of
time.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.349
And the big argument I
always make is, and

00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:13.894
ours like make this all the
time,

00:38:13.894 --> 00:38:16.560
sometimes people believe it
and sometimes they don&#39;t.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.260
Which is like if everything
just goes great,

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.730
it kind of doesn&#39;t matter
who investors are,.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.600
But almost never does
everything just go great.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.820
Right?
Even the big successful

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.680
companies even the big you
know, Facebook and all these

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.050
big companies that are now
considered very successful.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.320
You know, along the way all
kinds of shit went,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.130
you know, shit hit the fan
over and over and

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.870
over and over again.

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.270
And there are any number of
stressful board meetings and

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.840
discussions and

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.440
late night meetings with the
future of the company at

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.290
stake where everybody really
has to be on the same team.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.280
And have the same goals and

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.370
be pulling in the same
direction and

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:44.740
have a shared understanding.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.590
That have the right kind of
ethics and the right kind of

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.560
staying power, you know, to
be able to actually weather

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.380
the storms that come up.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.790
And one of the things that
you&#39;ll find that is a big

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.450
difference between first
time founders versus second

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.560
time founders is almost
always second time

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.740
founders take that point
much more seriously.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.220
After they&#39;ve been through
it once, and so

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.820
it really, really, really
matters.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.630
I always thought, and I
believe that it does.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.050
It really matters who your
partner is, it really is

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.830
like getting married, and it
is worth putting the same

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.070
amount of time, maybe not
quite as much time and

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.020
effort into picking your
spouse, but

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.190
it is worth spending
significant time really

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.250
understanding who you&#39;re
about to be partnered with.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Because that&#39;s way

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.390
more important than.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.840
You know, did I get another
$5 million in

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.100
the valuation or did, you
know,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.654
did I get another $2 million
in the check?

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:27.470
&gt;&gt; The marriage analogy is
great.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:31.860
I know at SV Angel, our
attitude is when we

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.650
invest in an entrepreneur,
we are investing for life.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.420
Because we wanna invest in,
if we made the right

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.690
decision, we&#39;re gonna invest
in every company they start.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.020
And, once an entrepreneur,
always an entrepreneur.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.890
So we actually do consider
it a marriage.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.190
We&#39;re, investing for life.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.470
&gt;&gt; One thing that I,

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.570
that, which is another of
saying what Mark just said,

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.412
is I always look for.

00:39:55.412 --> 00:39:56.741
In that first meeting,

00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:59.430
do you feel like you respect
this person?

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.470
And do you feel like

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.820
you have a lot to learn from
them?

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:08.213
Cuz sometimes you walk in
and they have this like just

00:40:08.213 --> 00:40:15.200
such an incredible amount of
insight in your business.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.110
That you walk out of there
being like, man, I don&#39;t,

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.980
even if these guys didn&#39;t
invest, that sort of hour

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.470
that I spent with them was
such a great use of my time.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.120
I felt like I came out with
a much clearer picture of

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.520
what I need to do and where
I need to go.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.400
And that&#39;s such a great
microcosm of what

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.410
the next couple of years are
gonna be like.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.720
You know like, don&#39;t if you
feel like you would want

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.410
this person really involved
in the company even if they

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.990
didn&#39;t have like a checkbook
that they brought with them.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:46.395
And if not that&#39;s probably a
very bad sign.

00:40:46.395 --> 00:40:49.396
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s the constraint on
the V

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:53.213
making accurate use of
angels and VCs?

00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:57.377
Time, money, or the lack of
company?

00:40:57.377 --> 00:40:59.555
&gt;&gt; Well what&#39;s the
constraint on

00:40:59.555 --> 00:41:02.325
how many companies you guys
invest in?

00:41:02.325 --> 00:41:05.432
&gt;&gt; SV Angels has kinda
gotten comfortable with one

00:41:05.432 --> 00:41:06.750
a week.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.780
You certainly can&#39;t do more
than that, and

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.190
that&#39;s a staff of 13.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.590
So it&#39;s, it&#39;s really the
number of companies.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.100
&gt;&gt; Ron, if you had,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.160
if you all worked twice the
number of hours,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.860
would you invest in twice
the number of companies?

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.320
&gt;&gt; I would advise against
that,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.540
I would rather just add
value,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.240
more value to the existing
companies.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.010
&gt;&gt; Maybe you could,

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.795
I&#39;ll take the role of
questioner for a second.

00:41:30.795 --> 00:41:31.470
&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER] Maybe you
could,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.150
could you talk a little bit
about conflict policy?

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.970
&gt;&gt; Or not, or not conflict
policy.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.410
&gt;&gt; Well SV Angel actually
does

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.610
have a written conflict
policy.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.100
But most, when we end up
with a conflict it&#39;s usually

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.080
because one company has
morphed into another space.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.990
We don&#39;t normally,

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.840
invest in companies that
have a direct conflict.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.580
If we do we will disclose it
to the other company,

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.180
to both companies.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.410
And keep in mind at our
stage,

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.210
we don&#39;t know the company&#39;s
project strategy anyway.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.670
We probably don&#39;t know
enough to disclose.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:06.600
But our conflict policy also
talks about

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.600
this really important word,
which is trust.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.600
In other words,

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.900
we&#39;re off to a bad start if
we don&#39;t trust each other.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.280
And, and with SV Angel, the
relationship between

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.260
the founder and us, is based
on trust.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:24.939
And if somebody doesn&#39;t
trust us

00:42:24.939 --> 00:42:27.494
then they shouldn&#39;t, they
shouldn&#39;t work with us.

00:42:27.494 --> 00:42:29.210
&gt;&gt; Mark, would you invest in
companies?

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.411
&gt;&gt; yeah.
So this is actually-

00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:32.200
So, let me go back to the
original question.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:32.830
I&#39;ll come back to that.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.320
So the original question is
this is the thing we

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.580
talk about most often in our
firm.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.880
So this is kind of the,

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.850
the question is at the heart
of I think how all venture

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.690
capital operates which is a
question of constraints.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.320
So the big constraint on

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.810
a top tier venture capital
firm the big

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.859
constraint is the concept of
opportunity cost.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.910
So, it&#39;s the concept that
basically everything you

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.280
do means that there are a
whole bunch of

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.270
other things that you can&#39;t
do.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.160
And so, it&#39;s not so much the
cost.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.630
And, and we think about this
all the time.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.260
It&#39;s not so much the cost
of,

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.230
we invest five million
dollars in a company, and

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.470
the company goes wrong and
we lose the money.

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.340
That&#39;s not really the loss
that we&#39;re worried about.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.866
Because the theory is will
have

00:43:04.866 --> 00:43:07.400
the winners that&#39;ll make up
for that in theory.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.700
The cost that we&#39;re worried
about,

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.660
is, every investment we make
has,

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.110
has two implications for how
we run the firm.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.570
Every investment we make,

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.250
number one rules out
conflicts, and so, for

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.740
sure our policy for sure on
venture and growth rounds,

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.580
is that we don&#39;t invest in
conflicting companies.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.040
And so we only invest in one
company in a category.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.280
And, so, if we invest in
MySpace, and

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.930
then Facebook comes along a
year later.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:28.620
Like, we&#39;re out.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.705
We can&#39;t do it, right?

00:43:30.705 --> 00:43:32.530
And so we basically lock,

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.790
every investment we make
locks us out of a category.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:35.835
Right?
And, the nature, that&#39;s

00:43:35.835 --> 00:43:37.566
a very complicated topic
when you&#39;re discussing these

00:43:37.566 --> 00:43:39.570
things internally in these
firms at first because.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.590
You only know the companies
that already exist right?

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.090
You don&#39;t know the companies
that haven&#39;t even

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.510
been founded yet right?

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.660
And God help you had you
invested in you know,

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.340
an early company that was
not gonna be the winner and

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.560
you were locked out by the
time you know,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.250
the winner emerged three
years later and

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.480
you just couldn&#39;t make the
investment.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.350
So that&#39;s one issue, is
conflict policy.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.840
The other issue is
opportunity cost.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.910
The time and bandwidth of
the general partners and so

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.550
going back to the concept of
adding value,

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.520
you know we&#39;re a firm
typical, typical firm we&#39;re

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.880
fairly typical firm we&#39;ve
eight general partners,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.060
each general partner can
maybe be on 10, 10 to 12

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.030
boards in total if they&#39;re
completely fully loaded.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.450
So it&#39;s basically Warren
Buffet talks a lot

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:16.860
about investing as you
basically want to think of

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.390
it as a ticket that you have
a limited amount of

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.630
holes you can punch and
every time you

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.570
make an investment you punch
the hole.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:22.580
And when you&#39;re out of,

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.260
when you&#39;re out of holes to
punch like you&#39;re done,

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.300
you can&#39;t make any new
investments.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.360
And that&#39;s very much how
venture capital operates and

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.530
so the way to think about is
every open board

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.990
slot that one of our GPs has
at any given point in

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.020
time is an asset of the firm
that can be

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.720
deployed against an
opportunity.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.800
But every time we make an
investment it takes

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.250
the number of slots that we
can punch down by one.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:44.232
So, it reduces the ability
for

00:44:44.232 --> 00:44:45.839
the firm to do new deals.

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:47.153
And so every investment we

00:44:47.153 --> 00:44:49.722
make forecloses not just the
competitive set, but

00:44:49.722 --> 00:44:52.186
other deals where we will
simply run out of time.

00:44:52.186 --> 00:44:54.889
And so, and this is sort of
a big thing of like well.

00:44:54.889 --> 00:44:56.137
This goes back to what I
said earlier.

00:44:56.137 --> 00:44:57.433
Like this company&#39;s pretty
good.

00:44:57.433 --> 00:44:58.657
It seems fairly obvious that
it&#39;s going to

00:44:58.657 --> 00:44:59.306
raise extra funding.

00:44:59.306 --> 00:45:00.155
Why didn&#39;t you fund it?

00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:01.238
Well, on its own if we

00:45:01.238 --> 00:45:03.890
had unlimited capacity we
probably would have.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.360
Like it&#39;ll probably make
money.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.486
But relative to getting
blocked out of

00:45:07.486 --> 00:45:08.814
the competitive set and

00:45:08.814 --> 00:45:11.339
relative not having that
open seat for a, for

00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:15.205
an even better opportunity
we pass on that basis a lot.

00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:22.623
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s pretty widely agreed
that, that that&#39;s it&#39;s

00:45:22.623 --> 00:45:26.872
easier than ever to build an
MVP launched get traction.

00:45:26.872 --> 00:45:30.263
Same time we know that there
are CPOs that have been

00:45:30.263 --> 00:45:33.745
pre-MVP or even pre-launch
and pre-traction.

00:45:33.745 --> 00:45:36.602
So in those instances where
you do a seed round with

00:45:36.602 --> 00:45:39.050
a company either doesn&#39;t
have a or

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.519
doesn&#39;t have a launch
impressive traction.

00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:44.282
What do those deals look
like and

00:45:44.282 --> 00:45:46.511
what do you make that
judgment based on?

00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:48.667
What convinces you to invest
with product with and

00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:49.290
no traction?

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.200
&gt;&gt; What would convince us,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.370
which is what usually
convinces us,

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:58.830
is the founder and their
team themselves.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.700
So we invest in people
first.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.400
Not necessarily the product
idea.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:06.070
The product ideas tend to
morph a lot.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.030
So we will invest in, in the
team first.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:13.420
If it&#39;s, if it&#39;s pre-users,
the valuation is gonna tend

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.980
to be corresponding lower
unless one of the founders,

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.960
you know, has a, a success
track record.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for us it&#39;s almost
always, if there&#39;s nothing

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.390
at the time of investment,
then it&#39;s almost, other than

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:28.870
a plan it&#39;s almost always
the founder who we&#39;ve worked

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:30.580
with before or a founder
who&#39;s very well known.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.600
By the way the other thing
worth highlighting is,

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.210
you kind of, in these
conversations,

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.160
in all these conversations,
you kinda, the default

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.950
assumptions is that we&#39;re
all starter web companies or

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.810
consumer mobile companies.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:42.440
There are, you know other
categories or companies,

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.030
capital intensive is one
that&#39;s been brought up,

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.310
but it&#39;s I&#39;ll just say for

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.730
example, enterprise software
companies.

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.650
Or enterprise these days
Saas, you know,

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.690
application companies or
cloud companies.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.510
It&#39;s much more common that
there&#39;s no MVP right.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.110
It&#39;s much more common that
they&#39;re a cold start.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.110
And it&#39;s much more common
that they

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.380
build a product in the A
round.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:58.550
Then there&#39;s no point to
have an MVP cuz

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.690
the customer&#39;s not gonna buy
an MVP the customer actually

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:03.210
needs the full product when
they first start using it.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.772
And so the company actually
needs to raise 5 or

00:47:04.772 --> 00:47:07.260
10 million dollars to get
the first product built.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.340
But in almost all those
cases that&#39;s gonna be

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:10.810
a founder who&#39;s done it
before.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:20.613
I think we have time for one
more question.

00:47:20.613 --> 00:47:21.186
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Could you talk

00:47:21.186 --> 00:47:22.495
about the ideal Boris
structure and

00:47:22.495 --> 00:47:24.031
when do you think expect to
publish that?

00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:24.581
&gt;&gt; Yes, talk about the ideal
Boris structure.

00:47:26.284 --> 00:47:33.500
&gt;&gt; Gosh, I think So, so in
our board we&#39;re fortunate

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.907
that we have, there&#39;s myself
and my cofounder, and a.

00:47:37.907 --> 00:47:40.600
Partner from Adruse and
Horowitz.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.160
Which I think probably
removes the fear.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.110
It probably creates a little
more trust cuz it sort of

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.860
removes the fear that like,
you know, someone&#39;s going to

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.380
come in and just like, fire
you arbitrarily because it&#39;s

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.280
like, time for a big company
CEO.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.400
Kind of thing.
But I,

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.880
in most cases I think if
you, if you trust,

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.900
if you trust the people that
you&#39;re working with it,

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:01.140
it shouldn&#39;t really be an
issue.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.100
Cuz there are so, there are
so few.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.610
I mean things almost never
come to like a board vote.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:09.190
And by the time that they do
it&#39;s like somethings deeply

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.810
broken at that point anyway.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.330
and, and most of.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.760
And most of the power that
VCs have comes outside of

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.720
the board structure, it&#39;s
protective covenants that

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.620
are build into the financing
round so it&#39;s like you can&#39;t

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.550
you know, take on debt, you
can&#39;t sell the company.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:25.610
There are certain things
that you

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.870
can&#39;t do without them
agreeing to it anyway.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.450
So it&#39;s probably like less
of a big deal than people

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.060
make it out to be.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:34.860
What I found, sort of,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.910
is, is that it seems to me
that, as a founder.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.690
If things are going well at
the company,

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:42.130
you have sort of unlimited
power, vis a vis,

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:43.240
your investors.

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.320
Like, almost unlimited.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.110
Like, no matter what the
board structure is, and

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:48.530
no matter what the covenants
are in the round.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:50.460
Like, if you say, listen, I
wanna do this, and

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.010
I think this is what we need
to do.

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.530
And even if it&#39;s, like, a
good investor or

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.520
a bad investor.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.030
Even the bad investors will
be, like, you know?

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:58.410
Like, let&#39;s, let&#39;s, let&#39;s
make it happen.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.100
Cuz they wanna like ride
this rocket ship with you.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.850
And when things are going
badly it does not

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:04.520
matter what protections
you&#39;ve built into

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.950
the system for yourself.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.480
Like, you know, at the end
of the day, like,

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.670
you need to go back to the
trough to get more money.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.010
And you know, if, if, like,
things aren&#39;t going well,

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.970
like they&#39;re gonna have all,

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.130
all of the cards in their
hand.

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:17.520
&gt;&gt; And they&#39;re gonna get to
renegotiate all the terms.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.900
&gt;&gt; And, exactly they&#39;ll
change all the terms.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:19.810
&gt;&gt; This is what happens
actually when

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:20.960
a company gets in dire
straights.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.840
Their it actually doesn&#39;t
matter what the terms, but

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.210
at fire rounds they all get
renegotiated.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:25.790
&gt;&gt; This is I think

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:28.300
the fundamental rule of
raising money.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.507
Other than never having down
turns is that if

00:49:30.507 --> 00:49:32.790
things are going well the
founder is in control and

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:33.960
this company needs more
money and

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.870
things going badly, if
investors are in control.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.110
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve been on boards for
20 years public and

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.360
private, I have never been a
board vote that mattered.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.160
It&#39;s always been never,
never a vote.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.010
Many discussions, many
controversies, many issues.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.040
Never a vote.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.370
It&#39;s the decision has always
been clear by the end.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.780
And it&#39;s either by unanimous
or very close to unanimous.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.760
And so I think it is almost
all around the intangibles

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.300
and almost not at all around
the details.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.092
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Thank you

00:49:59.092 --> 00:50:00.080
guys very much for coming in
today.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.766
&gt;&gt; Pleasure.

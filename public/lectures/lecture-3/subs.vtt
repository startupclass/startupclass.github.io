WEBVTT

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:03.431
That short.

00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:07.280
Like, long introductions are
no good.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.730
Sam knows.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.290
Alright, ready, everybody?

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.290
I&#39;m not gonna ask if the mic
is working like in

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.710
every talk so far.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.558
I&#39;ll just assume it&#39;s
working.

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:18.150
&gt;&gt; No!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.920
&gt;&gt; No, fuck!

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:24.080
&gt;&gt; All right, well make it
work somebody.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.108
&gt;&gt; It works, it works

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:28.436
&gt;&gt; All right, this is like
some kinda class tradition.

00:00:28.436 --> 00:00:31.043
All right, all right.

00:00:31.043 --> 00:00:32.483
I wrote out my talk and

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:35.523
afterwards in a couple days
I will like turn it

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.410
from a talk into an essay
and put it online.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.850
So, you don&#39;t have to take
notes, just, just listen.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.960
All right.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.912
So, one of the advantages of
having kids is

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:48.187
that when you have to give
advice to people,

00:00:48.187 --> 00:00:50.906
you can ask yourself, what
would I tell my own kids?

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.270
And actually, you find this
really focuses you.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.963
So, even though my kids are
little.

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:58.239
My two year old today,

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.405
when I asked what he was
gonna be after two?

00:01:00.405 --> 00:01:02.006
He said a bat.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.710
The correct answer was
three.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.040
But a bat is so much more
interesting.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.480
So even though my kids are
little,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.310
I already know what I would
tell them about startups if

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.510
they were in college.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.485
And so that is what I am
gonna tell you.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:16.670
So, you&#39;re literally getting
what I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.470
would give my own kids,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.002
since most of you are young
enough to be my own kids.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:22.864
All right.
So,

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:25.963
startups are very
counterintuitive.

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:27.705
And I&#39;m not sure exactly
why,

00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:30.787
it could be simply because
knowledge about them has not

00:01:30.787 --> 00:01:32.730
permeated our culture yet.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.390
But, whatever the reason,
this is an area where you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.240
cannot trust you&#39;re
intuitions all the time.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.010
It&#39;s like skiing in that
way.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.730
Any of you guys learn to ski
as adults?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.730
You know, when you&#39;re
skiing,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.790
when you first try skiing
and you want to slow down,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.680
your first impulse is to
lean back,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.690
just like in everything
else,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.350
but lean back on skis and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.600
you fly down the hill out of
control, so, as I learned.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.380
So, part of learning to ski
is learning to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.920
suppress that impulse.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.340
Eventually, you get new
habits.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.880
But in the beginning there&#39;s
this list of things you&#39;re

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.560
trying to remember as you
start down the hill.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.800
You know, like alternate
feet, make s-turns,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.182
do not drag the inside foot,
all this stuff.

00:02:11.182 --> 00:02:14.270
Well, startups are as
unnatural as

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.090
skiing and there is a
similar list of stuff you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.910
have to remember for
startups.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.690
And what Iâ€™m gonna give you
today is the beginning of

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.540
the list.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.480
The list of the
counterintuitive stuff you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.000
have to remember to like
prevent your

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.970
existing instincts from
leading you astray.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.860
The first thing on it, is
the fact that I just

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.890
mentioned that startups are
so weird that if you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.811
follow your instincts they
will lead you astray.

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.033
If you remember nothing more
than that.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.322
When you&#39;re about to make a
mistake,

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:45.660
you may at least pause
before making it.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.990
When I was running Y
Combinator,

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.780
we used to joke that our
function was to tell

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.440
founders things they would
ignore.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.780
And it&#39;s really true.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.180
Batch after batch, the YC
partners warn founders about

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.390
mistakes they are about to
make.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.170
And the founders ignore
them.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.500
And they come back a year
later and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.550
say, I wish we&#39;d listened.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.390
But, that dude is in their
cap table and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.820
there&#39;s nothing they can do.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.590
Why do founders persistently
ignore the partner&#39;s advice?

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.642
Well, that&#39;s the thing about
counterintuitive ideas, they

00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:21.939
contradict your intuitions,
so they seem wrong.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.620
So, of course you&#39;re first
impulse is to ignore them.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.990
And in fact that is not just
the curse of Y Combinator,

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.470
but to some extent our You
don&#39;t need people to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.140
give you advice that doesn&#39;t
surprise you, right?

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.290
If founder&#39;s existing
intuitions gave them

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.320
the right answers they
wouldn&#39;t need us.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.350
That&#39;s why there are a lot
of ski instructors and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.450
not a lot of running
instructors.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.987
You don&#39;t see those two
words together,

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:50.952
running instructor, as much
as you see ski instructor.

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:53.468
It&#39;s because skiing is
counterintuitive.

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.551
So sorta, what YC is,

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.833
is like business ski
instructors, except for

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:03.693
going up the slopes instead
of down them.

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:05.898
Well, ideally,

00:04:05.898 --> 00:04:11.750
you can however trust your
instincts about people.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.790
You, your life so far hasn&#39;t
been much like

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.650
starting a startup, but all
the interactions you&#39;ve had

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.660
with people are just like
the interactions you&#39;ve had

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.110
with people in the business
world.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.920
So, in fact one of

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.320
the big mistakes that
founders make is to not

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.340
trust their intuitions about
people enough.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.380
They meet someone who seems
impressive, but

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.686
about whom they feel some
misgivings.

00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:33.097
And then later, when things
blow up,

00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:35.573
they tell themselves, they
say, you know,

00:04:35.573 --> 00:04:38.310
I knew there was something
wrong about that guy, but

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.867
I ignored it because he
seemed so impressive.

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:43.782
And there&#39;s a specific
sub-case in business,

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:47.193
especially if you come from
an engineering background as

00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:48.481
I believe you all do.

00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:50.463
You think business is
supposed to be

00:04:50.463 --> 00:04:53.095
this sorta slightly
distasteful thing.

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:55.531
And so when you meet people
who seem smart, but

00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:57.387
somehow distasteful you
think well,

00:04:57.387 --> 00:04:59.306
okay this must be normal for
business.

00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:00.725
But it&#39;s not.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.618
Just like pick people the
way you would pick people if

00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:05.140
you were picking friends.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.880
This is one of those rare
cases where it

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.660
works to be self indulgent.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.017
Work with people you
genuinely like and respect

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:15.861
and that you have known long
enough to be sure.

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:17.491
Because there&#39;s a lot of
people who

00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.730
are really good at seeming
likeable for a while.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.209
Just wait till your
interests are opposed and

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.791
then you&#39;ll see.

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:25.148
All right.

00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:28.897
The second counterintuitive
point is that, and this

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:32.739
will, might come as a little
bit of a disappointment.

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:36.068
But what you need to succeed
in a startup is

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:39.140
not expertise in startups.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.560
That makes this class
different from most other

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.820
classes you take.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.990
You take a French class at
the end of it you will

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.890
learn how to speak French if
you do the work.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.950
You may not sound exactly
like a French person,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.300
but pretty close, right?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.650
This class can teach you
about startups but

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.410
that is not what you need to
know.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.150
What you need to know
to suceed in a startup is not

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.930
expertise in startups,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.160
what you need is expertise
in your own users.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.280
Mark Zuckerberg did not
succeed in

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.900
Facebook because he was an
expert in startups.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.070
He succeeded despite being a
complete noob at startups.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.860
I mean, Facebook was

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.260
first incorporated as a
Florida LLC.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.060
Even you guys know better
than that.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.840
He succeeded despite being a
complete noob at startups

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.620
because he understood his
users very well.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.130
Most of you don&#39;t know the
mechanics of

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.377
raising an Angel round.

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:38.556
Right, and if you feel bad
about that, don&#39;t, because I

00:06:38.556 --> 00:06:41.481
can tell you Mark Zuckerberg
probably doesn&#39;t know

00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:44.164
the mechanics of raising an
Angel round either.

00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:47.186
If he was even paying
attention when Ron Conway

00:06:47.186 --> 00:06:48.811
wrote him the big check,

00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:51.611
he has probably forgotten
about it by now.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:54.845
In fact, I worry, it&#39;s not
merely unnecessary for

00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:57.485
people to learn in detail
about the mechanics of

00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.659
starting a startup, but
possibly somewhat dangerous.

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.748
Because another of the
characteristic mistakes of

00:07:03.748 --> 00:07:06.764
young founders starting
startups is to go through

00:07:06.764 --> 00:07:08.960
the motions of starting a
startup.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.500
They come up with some
plausible sounding idea.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.140
They raise funding at a nice
valuation.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.660
They rent a nice office in
Soma,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.590
hire a bunch of their
friends.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.020
And then the next step,
after rent a nice

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.600
office in Soma and hire a
bunch of their friends,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.160
is gradually realize how
completely fucked they are.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.230
Because while imitating all
the outward forms of

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.560
starting a startup,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.590
they have neglected the one
thing that&#39;s actually

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.190
essential which is to make
something people want.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.500
By the way, that&#39;s the only
use of that swear word

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.670
except for the initial one
that was involuntary.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.876
And I did check with Sam
whether it would be okay.

00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:52.035
He said he had done it
several times.

00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:53.072
I mean, used the word.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:08.085
&gt;&gt; We saw this happen so
often, No, I mean people

00:08:08.085 --> 00:08:10.041
going through the motions of
starting a startup.

00:08:12.624 --> 00:08:15.180
&gt;&gt; That we made up a name
for it.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.080
Playing house.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.720
Eventually, I realized why
it was happening.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.230
The reason young founders go
through the motions of

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.710
starting a startup is

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.590
because that is what they
have been trained to do for

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.250
their whole lives up to this
point.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.097
Think about what it takes to
get into college.

00:08:32.097 --> 00:08:35.595
Extracurricular activities,
check.

00:08:35.595 --> 00:08:36.745
Right?

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:40.385
Even in college classes,
most of the work you do is

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.735
as artificial as running
laps.

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:45.741
And I am not attacking the
educational system for

00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:46.771
being this way.

00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:49.728
Inevitably, the work that
you do to learn something is

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:51.988
gonna have some amount of
fakeness to it.

00:08:51.988 --> 00:08:54.441
And if you measure people&#39;s
performance,

00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:56.884
they will inevitably exploit
the difference.

00:08:56.884 --> 00:08:59.333
To the degree that what
you&#39;re measuring is

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.500
largely an artifact of the
fakeness.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.880
And I confess that I did
this myself in college.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.700
In fact, here is a useful
tip on getting good grades.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.215
I found that in a lot of
classes there might only be

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:11.911
20 or 30 ideas that
actually,

00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.606
had the right shape to make
good exam questions.

00:09:14.606 --> 00:09:17.818
And so the way I studied for
exams in these classes was

00:09:17.818 --> 00:09:20.302
not to master the material
in the class.

00:09:20.302 --> 00:09:20.903
But to try and

00:09:20.903 --> 00:09:23.038
figure out what the exam
questions would be and

00:09:23.038 --> 00:09:24.583
work out the answers in
advance.

00:09:24.583 --> 00:09:27.283
Unlike, for me the test was
not like what my

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:29.160
answers would be on the
exam.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.440
For me the test was.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.230
Which of my exam questions
would turn up

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.930
on the exam, right?

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.100
So I would get my grade
instantly.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.280
I would walk into the exam
and

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.240
look at the questions and

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.060
see how many I got right
essentially.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.610
&gt;&gt; It works in a lot of
classes,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.926
especially CS classes.

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:48.636
I remember Automata Theory,
there&#39;s only a few

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:51.620
things that make sense to
ask about Automata Theory.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.494
So, it&#39;s not surprising that
after being effectively

00:09:54.494 --> 00:09:57.061
trained for their whole
lives to play such games,

00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:59.934
young founders first impulse
upon starting a startup is

00:09:59.934 --> 00:10:01.722
to figure out what the
tricks are.

00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:02.741
For this new game,

00:10:02.741 --> 00:10:05.673
what are the extracurricular
activities of startups,

00:10:05.673 --> 00:10:07.820
what are the things that I
have to do.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.789
They always wanna know
since,

00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:12.591
since apparently the measure
of success for

00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:16.104
a startup is fundraisingn
another noob mistake.

00:10:16.104 --> 00:10:18.494
They always wanna know, what
are the tricks for

00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:19.754
convincing investors.

00:10:19.754 --> 00:10:21.214
And we have to tell them,

00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:23.372
the best way to convince
investors,

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:26.989
is to start a startup that&#39;s
actually doing well, meaning

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:29.997
growing fast, and then
simply tell investors so.

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.385
So then they ask, okay, what
are the tricks for

00:10:32.385 --> 00:10:33.170
growing fast?

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.830
Alright?
And

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.960
this is exacerbated by the
existence of this term,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.320
growth hacks.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:39.830
Right?

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.270
Whenever you hear anybody
talk about growth hacks,

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.790
just mentally translate it
in your mind to bullshit.

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:50.630
Because what we tell them is
the way to make your startup

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.925
grow is to make something
that users really love.

00:10:53.925 --> 00:10:55.530
Right, and then tell them
about it.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:57.690
So that&#39;s what you have to
do.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.869
That is growth hacks right
there.

00:11:00.869 --> 00:11:03.963
So many of the conversations
the YC partners have with

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:07.128
the founders begin with the
founders saying a sentence

00:11:07.128 --> 00:11:08.791
that begins with, how do I.

00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:11.780
And the partner is answering
with a sentence that begins

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.550
with, just.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.346
Right, why do they make
things so complicated?

00:11:16.346 --> 00:11:17.386
The reason, I realized,

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:19.050
after years of being puzzled
by this,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.610
is they&#39;re looking for the
trick,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.598
they&#39;ve been trained to look
for the trick.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:25.360
So, this is the third thing.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.082
The third counterintuitive
thing to

00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:28.189
remember about startups.

00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:29.454
Starting a startup is

00:11:29.454 --> 00:11:31.850
where gaming the system
stops working.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.741
Gaming the system may
continue to work if you go

00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:36.980
to work for a big company.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.750
Depending on how broken the
company is you may be able

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.410
to succeed by sucking up to
the right person.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.690
Giving the impression of
productivity by sending

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.030
emails late at night.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.274
Or if your smart enough,

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:51.172
changing the clock on your
computer,

00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:54.212
cause whose going to check
the headers, right?

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:59.907
But, I like an audience I
tell jokes like that to and

00:11:59.907 --> 00:12:01.222
they laugh.

00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:06.511
Over in the business school,
headers, okay.

00:12:06.511 --> 00:12:10.327
God this thing is being
recorded,

00:12:10.327 --> 00:12:13.002
I just realized that.

00:12:13.002 --> 00:12:15.085
All right, from now on,

00:12:15.085 --> 00:12:17.818
we are sticking strictly to
the script.

00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:21.172
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:23.770
But in startups, that does
not work.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.050
There is no boss to trick.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.400
There&#39;s no, how can you
trick people if

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.050
there&#39;s no one to trick?

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.340
There&#39;s only users.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.870
And all users care about is
whether your software.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.390
Does what they want, right?

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.610
They&#39;re like sharks.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.180
Sharks are, like, too stupid
to fool.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.330
You can&#39;t, like, wave a red
flag at a shark and fool it,

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.507
it&#39;s like, meat or no meat.

00:12:43.507 --> 00:12:45.955
So, you have to have
something people want.

00:12:45.955 --> 00:12:48.795
And you only prosper to the
extend that you do.

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:50.181
The dangerous thing is,

00:12:50.181 --> 00:12:53.019
particularly for you guys,
the dangerous thing is

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:56.570
that faking does work to
some extent with investors.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.600
You, if you&#39;re really good
at

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.280
knowing what you&#39;re talking
about.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.870
You can fool investors for

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.920
one, maybe two rounds of
funding.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.630
But it&#39;s not in your
interest to.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.740
I mean, you&#39;re all doing
this for equity.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.090
You&#39;re playing a confidence
trick on yourself.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.280
You&#39;re wasting your own
time,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.920
because the startup is
doomed.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.030
And all you&#39;re doing is,

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.680
you&#39;re just gonna waste your
time writing it down.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.860
So, stop looking for the
trick.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.820
There are tricks in the
startups,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.300
as there are in any domain.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.060
But they are an order of
magnitude less

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.360
important than solving the
real problem.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.120
Someone who knows zero about
fund raising but

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.800
has made something users
really love will have

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.570
an easier time raising
money.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.440
Than someone who knows every
trick in the book, but

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.190
has a flat usage graph.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.240
Though in a sense it&#39;s bad
news that

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.980
gaming the startups stops
works gaming the system,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.170
stops working now.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.960
In a sense that you&#39;re
deprived of one of your most

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.130
powerful weapons and

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.360
afterall something you have
spent 20 years mastering.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.920
It is something, I find it
very exciting.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.750
That there even exists parts
of the world

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.140
where gaming the system is
not how you win.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.020
I would have been really
excited in college if I had

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.210
explicitly realized that
there were parts of

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:07.760
the world where

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.850
gaming the system matters
less than others.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.940
And some where it hardly
matters at all.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.930
But there are, and this is
one of the most important

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:17.220
things to think about when
you&#39;re planning your future.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.799
Got that, okay.

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:25.857
How do you win at each type
of the work?

00:14:25.857 --> 00:14:28.199
And what do you want to win
by doing?

00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:31.892
So, that brings us to

00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:34.130
our fourth counterintuitive
point.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.470
Startups are all consuming.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.620
If you start a start up, it
will take over your life

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.600
to a degree that you cannot
imagine.

00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:45.499
And if it succeeds, it will
take over your life for

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:46.196
a long time.

00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:48.025
For several years, at the
very least.

00:14:48.025 --> 00:14:49.680
Maybe a decade.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.370
Maybe the rest of your
working life.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.108
So there&#39;s a real
opportunity cost here,

00:14:54.108 --> 00:14:57.111
it may seem to you that
Larry Page has an enviable

00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:57.711
life, but

00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.808
there are parts of it that
are definitely unenviable.

00:15:00.808 --> 00:15:02.576
The way the world looks to
him,

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:05.228
is that he started running
as fast as he could at

00:15:05.228 --> 00:15:05.981
age 25.

00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:09.165
And he has not stopped to
catch his breath since.

00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:12.344
Every day, shit happens
within the Google empire

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:15.280
that only the emperor can
deal with.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.538
And he, as the emperor, has
to deal with it.

00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:19.680
If he goes on vacation for

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.470
even a week, a whole backlog
of shit accumulates.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.920
And he has to bear this
uncomplainingly, because,

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.710
number one, as the company&#39;s
daddy,

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.940
he can never show fear or
weakness.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.080
And number two, if you&#39;re a
billionaire,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.480
you get zero, actually less
than zero sympathy if you

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.420
complain about having a
difficult life.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.370
Which has this strange side
effect

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.800
that the difficulty of being
a successful startup founder

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.320
is concealed from almost
everyone who&#39;s done it.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.240
People who win the hundred
meters in the Olympics,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.180
like they walk up to them
and

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.580
they&#39;re going like, right.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.980
Larry Page is doing that
too, but

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.850
you never get to see it.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.850
All right, where are we?

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.150
Y Combinator has now funded
several companies that

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.280
could be called big
successes.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.800
And in every single case,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.490
the founders say the same
thing,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.280
it never gets any easier.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.010
The nature of the problems
change.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.230
So, you may be worrying
about more

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.890
glamorous problems like
construction delays in

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.950
your new London offices,
rather than the broken air

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.800
conditioner in your studio
apartment.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.860
But the total volume of
worry never decreases,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.940
if anything, it increases.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.130
Starting a successful
startup is similar to

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.600
having kids, in that it&#39;s
like a button you press,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.230
that changes your life
irrevocably.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.100
And while it is, like,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.700
honestly the best thing in
the world having kids.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.178
If you take away one thing
from this lecture,

00:16:45.178 --> 00:16:47.316
remember that.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.916
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of things
that are easier to do

00:16:51.916 --> 00:16:55.155
after you, before you have
kids, then after.

00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:57.126
Many of which will make you
a better parent,

00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:58.150
when you do have kids.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.590
And so, in rich countries,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.770
most people delay pushing
the button for a while.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.430
And I&#39;m sure you

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.070
are all intimately familiar
with that procedure.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:11.590
Yet, when it comes to
starting startups,

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.460
a lot of people seem to
think they&#39;re supposed to

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.770
start them in college.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.180
Are you crazy?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.090
And what are the
universities thinking?

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.180
They go out of their way to
ensure that their

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.810
students are well supplied
with contraceptives.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.680
And yet they&#39;re starting up
entrepreneurship programs

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.499
and startup incubators left
and right.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.810
&gt;&gt; To be fair,

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.020
the universities have their
hand forced here.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.140
A lot of incoming students
are interested in startups.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.100
Universities are at least
defacto,

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.780
supposed to prepare you for
your career.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.990
And so, if you&#39;re interested
in startups, it seems like

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.100
universities are supposed to
teach you about startups.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.420
And if they don&#39;t,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.200
maybe they loose applicants
to universities.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.780
You do claim to do that.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.220
So, can universities teach
you about startups?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.960
Well, if not what are we
doing here?

00:17:57.245 --> 00:18:00.228
&gt;&gt; Yes and no, as I explain,
they can teach you about

00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:03.520
startups, but this is not
what you need to know.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.810
Essentially, what universe,
if you wanna learn French,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.090
universities can teach you
linguistics.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.870
That&#39;s what this is.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.430
This is a linguistics class.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.370
Right?
We&#39;re teaching you

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.770
about how to learn
languages.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.950
And what you need to know is
like,

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.590
how to learn a particular
language?

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.470
What you need to know, are
the needs of your own users.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.580
You can&#39;t learn those,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.010
until you actually start the
company.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.970
And starting a company,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.870
which means that starting a
startup is something, and

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.610
you can intrinsically only
learn by doing it.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.390
And you can&#39;t do that in
college for

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.610
the reason I just explained,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.370
that startups take over your
entire life.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.850
If you start a startup in
college,

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.450
If you start up a startup as
a student,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.150
you can&#39;t start up a startup
as a student, because if

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.780
you start a startup you&#39;re
not a student anymore.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.210
You may be nominally a
student, but

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.190
you won&#39;t even be that for
much longer.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.120
So, given this dichotomy,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.290
which of the two paths
should you take?

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.624
Be a real student and not
start a startup or

00:18:54.624 --> 00:18:56.975
start a real startup and not
be a student.

00:18:56.975 --> 00:18:58.835
Well I can answer that one
for you.

00:18:58.835 --> 00:19:02.058
I&#39;m talking to my own kids
here.

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:05.610
Do not start a startup in
college.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.042
I hope I&#39;m not disappointing
anyone, seriously, honestly.

00:19:08.042 --> 00:19:12.260
Starting a startup could be
a component of

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.000
a good life for

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.960
a lot of ambitious people,
but this is just part of

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.510
a much bigger problem that
your trying to solve.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.640
How to have a good life,
right, and

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.330
though starting a startup
could be a good thing to

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.750
do at some point, 20 is not
the optimal time to do it.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.190
There are things, that, that
you canâ€™t, there are things

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.910
you can do in your early
20â€™s, that you cannot do as

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.290
well before or after, like
plunge deeply into

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.760
projects on a whim that seem
like they have no payoff.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.670
Or travel super cheaply with
no sense of a deadline.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.090
In fact those are really
just isomorphic shapes in

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.280
different domains.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.460
For unambitious people this
sort of thing can

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.070
be the dreaded failure to
launch.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.760
But for the ambitious ones,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.630
it&#39;s a really valuable sort
of exploration.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:58.910
And if you start a startup
at 20,

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.270
and you&#39;re sufficiently
successful,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.240
you will never get to do it.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.100
Mark Zuckerberg will never
get to

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.530
bum around a foreign
country.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.160
He can, if he goes to a
foreign country,

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.180
it&#39;s either as a defacto
state visit, or, like,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.910
he&#39;s hiding out incognito at
the George Cinc in Paris.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.560
Right?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.230
But he&#39;s never gonna get to
just, like,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.050
backpack around Thailand if
that&#39;s still what people do.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.450
Do people still backpack
around Thailand?

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.320
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay, well there,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.970
that&#39;s the first real sign
of enthusiasm I&#39;ve seen from

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.122
this audience.

00:20:31.122 --> 00:20:33.970
I should have given this
talk in Thailand.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.160
&gt;&gt; All right, he can do
things that you can&#39;t do,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.940
like charter jets to fly him
to foreign countries,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.650
really big jets.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.260
But success has taken a lot
of

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.830
the serendipity out of his
life.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.130
Facebook is running him as
much as he

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.250
is running Facebook.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.590
And while it can be really
cool to be in the grip of

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:59.790
some project you consider
your life&#39;s work,

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.970
there are advantages to
serendipity.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.350
And among other things, it
gives you more options to

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.530
choose your life&#39;s work
from.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.040
There&#39;s not even a trade-off
here.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.830
You&#39;re not sacrificing
anything if

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.930
you forego starting a
startup at 20,

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.700
cuz you&#39;ll be more likely to
succeed if you wait.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.961
In the unlikely case that
you&#39;re 20,

00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:24.486
like astronomically unlikely
case, that you&#39;re 20 and you

00:21:24.486 --> 00:21:27.694
have some side project that
takes off like Facebook did.

00:21:27.694 --> 00:21:30.122
Then you face the choice of
either running with it or

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.130
not, and maybe it&#39;s
reasonable to run with it.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.720
But usually the way startups
take off is for

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.270
the founders to make them
take off.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.098
It&#39;s gratuitously stupid to
do that at 20.

00:21:41.098 --> 00:21:44.499
So should you do it at any
age?

00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:47.536
I realize, I&#39;ve made
Starting a startup sound

00:21:47.536 --> 00:21:48.910
kind of hard.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.420
If I haven&#39;t, let me try
again.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.570
Starting a startup is really
hard.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.310
What if it&#39;s too hard?

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.460
What if you&#39;re not up to
this challenge?

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.390
The answer is the fifth
counter-intuitive point.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.260
You can&#39;t tell.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.900
Your life, so far,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.730
has given you some idea what
your prospects might be,

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:12.330
if you wanted to become a
mathematician, or

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.760
a professional football
player.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:16.940
Boy, it&#39;s not every audience
you could say that to.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.590
But unless you have had a
very strange life,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.100
indeed, you

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:24.020
have not done much that&#39;s
like starting a startup.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.640
Meaning, starting a startup
will change you a lot

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.850
if it works out.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.970
So, what you&#39;re trying to
estimate is not just what

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.160
you are, but what you could
become, and who can do that?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.850
Well, not me, for the last
nine years,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.982
it was my job to try and
guess whether people would.

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:41.113
Guess is, I wrote predicted
here and

00:22:41.113 --> 00:22:43.080
it came out as guess.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.300
That&#39;s a very informative
Freudian slip.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.720
&gt;&gt; Seriously, it&#39;s easy to
tell how smart people are in

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.260
ten minutes.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.080
You know, hit a few tennis
balls over the net and

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.450
do they hit them back at you
or into the net.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.630
But, the hard part was, and
the most important part was

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.930
predicting how tough and
ambitious they would become.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.680
There may be no one at this
point who

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.490
has more experience than me
at doing this.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:08.210
And I can tell you

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.988
how much an expert can know
about that.

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:12.310
The answer is, not much.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.170
I learned from experience to
keep a completely open

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.440
mind about which startup in
each batch,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.290
which startups would turn
out to be the stars.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.500
The founders sometimes
thought they knew.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.970
Some arrived feeling
confident that they

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.720
would ace Y Combinator,

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.930
just as they had aced every
one of the few, easy,

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.160
artificial tests they had
faced in life so far.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.960
Others arrived wondering
what mistake could cause

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.840
them to be admitted and

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.340
hoping that no one would
discover it.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.810
But there&#39;s little to no
correlation between these

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:46.309
attitudes in how things turn
out.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.082
I&#39;ve read the same is true
in the military that

00:23:51.082 --> 00:23:53.198
the swaggering recruits are
no more likely to

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:55.436
turn out to be really tough
than the quiet ones.

00:23:55.436 --> 00:23:58.354
And probably for the same
reason that the tests are so

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:01.480
different from the tests in
people&#39;s previous lives.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.940
If you&#39;re absolutely
terrified of

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.490
starting a startup, you
probably shouldn&#39;t do it,

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.470
unless you&#39;re one of those
people who

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.090
gets off on doing things
you&#39;re afraid of.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.370
Otherwise, if you&#39;re merely
unsure of

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.310
whether you&#39;re gonna be able
to do it,

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:18.420
the only way to find out is
to try, just not now.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.468
So, if you wanna startup one
day, if you wanna start

00:24:24.468 --> 00:24:28.170
a startup one day, what do
you do now in college?

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.966
There are only two things
you need initially,

00:24:30.966 --> 00:24:34.580
an idea, and co-founders.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.940
And the MO for getting them
both is the same,

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.260
which leads to our sixth,
sixth and

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.000
last counter-intuitive
point.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.870
The way to get startup
ideas,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.370
is not to try to think of
startup ideas.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:47.940
I&#39;ve written a whole essay
on this and

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.400
I&#39;m not gonna repeat the
whole thing here.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.180
But the short version is
that if you make

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.180
a conscious effort to try
and think of startup ideas,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.200
you will think of ideas that
are not only bad, but

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.080
bad and plausible sounding.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.310
Meaning you and everybody
else will be fooled by them,

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:03.200
and you&#39;ll waste a lot of

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.730
time before realizing
they&#39;re no good.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.290
The way to come up with good
startup ideas is

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.380
to take a step back.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.655
Instead of trying to make a
conscious effort to think of

00:25:13.655 --> 00:25:17.480
startup ideas, turn your
brain into the type that

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.480
has startup ideas
unconsciously.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.120
In fact, so

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.900
unconsciously that you don&#39;t
even realize at first that

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.920
they&#39;re startup ideas.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:31.720
This is not only possible,
Yahoo, Google, Facebook, and

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.920
Apple all got started this
way.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.610
None of these companies were
even supposed to be

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.210
companies at first, they
were all just side projects.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.060
The very best ideas almost
have to

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.540
start as side projects,
because they&#39;re always such

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.860
outliers that your conscious
mind would reject.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.260
As ideas for companies.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.180
Okay?

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.280
So, how do you turn your
mind into the kind that

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.310
has startup ideas
unconsciously?

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.500
1, learn about things that
matter.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.630
2, work on problems that
interest you.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:05.240
3, with people you like and
respect.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.830
That third part incidentally
is

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.660
how you get co-founders at
the same time as the idea.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.880
The first time I wrote that
paragraph,

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.570
instead of learn a lot about
things that matter,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.620
I wrote become good at some
technology.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.530
But that prescription,
though sufficient,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.150
is too narrow.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:27.560
What was special about Brian
Chesky and Joe Gebbia from

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.390
Airbnb was not they were
experts in technology.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:32.110
They went to art school.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.740
They were experts in design,
and

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.720
perhaps even more
importantly,

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.010
they were really good at
organizing people and

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:40.670
getting projects done.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.140
So, you don&#39;t have to work
on technology per se, so

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.380
long as you work on things
that stretch you.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.170
What kind of things are
those?

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:53.470
Now, that is very hard to
answer in the general case.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.080
History is full of examples
of young people who

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.090
were working on problems
that no one else,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.680
at the time, thought were
important.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.160
And in particular that their
parents didn&#39;t think they

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.090
were important.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.730
On the other hand, history
is even fuller

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.640
of examples of parents who
thought their kids were

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.720
wasting their time, and who
were right, so.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.270
&gt;&gt; How do you know if you&#39;re
working on real stuff?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.230
I mean when Twitch TV
switched from being

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:23.760
Justin Dot TV to Twitch TV,
and

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.840
they were gonna broadcast
people playing video games,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.010
I was like what?

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.660
But, turned out to be a good
business.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.110
Well, I know,

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:36.700
I know how I know, real
problems are interesting.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.930
And I&#39;m self-indulgent.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.180
I like, I&#39;m always
interested in

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.800
working on interesting
things even if

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.950
no one else cares about
them.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.990
And I find it very hard to
make myself work on boring

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.420
things even if they&#39;re
supposed to be important.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.420
My life is full of case
after case where I

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.710
worked on things just cuz I
was interested.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.660
And they turned out to be

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.205
useful later in some worldly
way.

00:27:55.205 --> 00:27:57.350
Y Combinator itself is
something I

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.340
only did because it seemed
interesting.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.060
So, I seem to

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.880
have some sort of internal
compass that helps me out.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.990
But, this is, for you, not
me and

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.300
I don&#39;t know what you have
in your heads.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.510
Maybe if I think more about
it I could come up with some

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.020
heuristics for recognizing
genuinely interesting ideas.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.300
But for now, all I can give
you is the hopelessly

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.250
question begging advice,
incidentally,

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.590
this is the actual meaning
of the phrase,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.660
begging the question.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.820
The hopelessly question
begging advice that if

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.910
you&#39;re interested in
genuinely interesting

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.010
problems, gratifying your
interest energetically is

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.680
the best way to prepare
yourself for a start-up.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.490
And, for that matter,

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.740
probably the best way to
live.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.100
But although I can&#39;t explain
in

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.880
the general case what counts
as an interesting problem,

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.800
I can tell you about a large
subset of them.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.980
If you think of technology
as something

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.300
that&#39;s spreading like a sort
of fractal stain,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.640
every point on the edge
that&#39;s moving,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.358
represents an interesting
problem.

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:55.460
Steam engines is not so

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.490
much, although maybe, you
never know.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.750
So, one guaranteed way to
turn your mind into the type

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.340
that startup ideas form in
unconsciously is to

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.680
get yourself to the leading
edge of some technology, to,

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.500
as Paul Buchheit put it,
live in the future.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.250
And when you get there,
ideas that seem uncannily

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.620
prescient to some people
will seem obvious to you.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.030
You may not realize they&#39;re
startup ideas, but you&#39;ll

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.300
know they&#39;re something that
ought to exist.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.900
For example, back at
Harvard,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.520
back in the mid 90s,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.980
a fellow grad student of my
friends Robert and

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.670
Trevor, wrote his own
voiceover IP software.

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.280
It wasn&#39;t meant to be a
startup.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.880
He never tried to turn it
into one.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.630
He just wanted to talk to
his girlfriend in

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.210
Taiwan without paying for
long distance calls.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.870
And since he was an expert
on networks,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:49.050
it seemed obvious to him
that the thing to do was to

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.850
turn the sound into packets
and

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.730
ship them over the Internet
for free.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.840
Why didn&#39;t everybody do
this?

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.492
Well because they weren&#39;t
good at writing that kind

00:29:57.492 --> 00:29:58.492
of software.

00:29:58.492 --> 00:29:59.770
He never did anything with
this.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.281
He never tried to turn it
into a startup.

00:30:01.281 --> 00:30:05.683
But that is how all the best
startups tend to happen.

00:30:05.683 --> 00:30:08.858
So, strangely enough, the
optimal thing to do in

00:30:08.858 --> 00:30:12.335
college if you wanna be a
successful startup founder,

00:30:12.335 --> 00:30:15.132
is not some sort of new
vocational version of

00:30:15.132 --> 00:30:18.160
college focused on
entrepreneurship.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.980
Itâ€™s the classic version of
college as education for

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.629
its own sake.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:24.550
If you wanna start a
startup, what you

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:28.810
should do in college is
learn powerful things.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.590
And if you have genuine
intellectual curiosity,

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.130
that&#39;s what you&#39;ll naturally
tend to

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.760
do if you just follow your
own inclinations.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.210
The component of
entrepreneurship,

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.590
I can never quite say that
word with a straight face,

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.960
that really matters is
domain expertise.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.460
Larry Page is Larry Page cuz
he was an expert on search.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.226
And the way he became an
expert on search,

00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:53.244
was because he was genuinely
interested in it,

00:30:53.244 --> 00:30:54.865
not because of some ulterior
motive.

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:55.761
At its best,

00:30:55.761 --> 00:30:59.265
starting a startup is merely
an ulterior motive for

00:30:59.265 --> 00:31:02.607
curiosity and you&#39;ll do it
best if you introduce

00:31:02.607 --> 00:31:05.799
the ulterior motive at the
end of the process.

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:09.849
So here, is the ultimate
advice for young would-be

00:31:09.849 --> 00:31:14.000
startup founders reduced to
two words, just learn.

00:31:15.112 --> 00:31:16.352
All right, how much time do
we have left?

00:31:16.352 --> 00:31:17.873
&gt;&gt; 18 minutes.

00:31:17.873 --> 00:31:20.358
&gt;&gt; 18 minutes of questions,
good god,

00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:22.840
do you guys have the
questions?

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.509
&gt;&gt; Sure, weâ€™ll start with,
two questions online or

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:26.882
we can start with others.

00:31:26.882 --> 00:31:28.813
&gt;&gt; You guys are in charge,
whatever you wanna do.

00:31:28.813 --> 00:31:32.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.210
So, to start with, online
questions.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.040
The most voted question
today was-

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.700
&gt;&gt; Do I have to repeat them,
by the way?

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.257
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:31:40.257 --> 00:31:42.267
&gt;&gt; How can a non-technical
founder most

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:44.350
effectively contribute to a
startup?

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.092
&gt;&gt; How can a non-technical
founder most

00:31:46.092 --> 00:31:47.895
effectively contribute to a
startup?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.064
Well, if the startup is,

00:31:51.064 --> 00:31:54.481
if the startup is working in
some domain.

00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:57.358
If it&#39;s not a pure
technology startup, but

00:31:57.358 --> 00:32:00.546
is working in some very
specific domain, like,

00:32:00.546 --> 00:32:02.590
if it&#39;s Uber, right?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.873
And the, and the
non-technical founder was

00:32:04.873 --> 00:32:06.854
an expert in the limo
business, then,

00:32:06.854 --> 00:32:09.799
actually, the non-technical
founder would probably be

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:12.201
doing most of the work,
recruiting drivers and

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:14.440
doing whatever else Uber has
to do, right?

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.307
And the technical founder
will be just writing

00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:20.761
the iPhone app, which is
probably less, well, iPhone

00:32:20.761 --> 00:32:24.240
and Android app, hm, which
is less than half of it.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.551
If it&#39;s a purely technology
startup, the,

00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.611
the non-technical founder
does sales.

00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:31.835
And brings coffee and

00:32:31.835 --> 00:32:33.879
cheeseburgers to the
programmer.

00:32:35.302 --> 00:32:36.652
&gt;&gt; Okay, next.

00:32:38.099 --> 00:32:39.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, audience?

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.590
Okay, audience, yes?

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.910
&gt;&gt; Do you see,

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:47.330
any value in business school
for people who want to

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:48.025
pursue entrepreneur,
entrepreneurship?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.240
&gt;&gt; Do I see any value in.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.530
&gt;&gt; Or, if so, what value, I
guess?

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.735
I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s not.

00:32:52.735 --> 00:32:54.303
&gt;&gt; Well, we probably won&#39;t
have to get to

00:32:54.303 --> 00:32:55.213
the second question.

00:32:57.153 --> 00:32:58.427
&gt;&gt; Which I suppose is the
answer to

00:32:58.427 --> 00:32:59.360
your first question.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.370
Okay, so the question is, is
there any value in business

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:05.600
school if you&#39;re interested
in entrepreneurship?

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.440
And, if so, what?

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.980
So, basically, no.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.602
I mean, it sounds
undiplomatic, but

00:33:11.602 --> 00:33:15.240
the point, what business
school was designed for

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.650
is to teach people
management, right?

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:21.290
And management is a problem
that you only have in

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.530
a startup if you&#39;re
sufficiently successful.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.388
So, really,

00:33:25.388 --> 00:33:28.185
what you need to, what you
need to know early on to

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:31.600
make a startup successful,
is developing products.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.760
You&#39;d be better off going to
design school,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.850
if you want to go to some
sort of school.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:36.620
Although frankly,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.800
the way to learn how to do
it is just to do it,

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.160
you know?

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.740
One of the things I got
wrong early on,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.190
is that I advised people who
were interested in starting

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.680
a startup to go work for
some other company for

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.680
a few years before starting
their own.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.300
But, honestly, the best way
to learn how to

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.080
start a startup is to try
and start it.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.120
You may not be successful,
but

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.895
you&#39;ll learn faster if you
just do it.

00:33:56.895 --> 00:33:59.390
So, not really.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.100
Business schools are trying
really hard to do this, but

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.900
honestly, like, they were,
they were designed to

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.540
train the officer corps of
large companies, right?

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.232
Which is what business
seemed to be,

00:34:12.232 --> 00:34:14.688
back when it was a choice of
either the officer corps of

00:34:14.688 --> 00:34:17.030
large companies or Joe&#39;s
Shoe Store.

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.550
And then, then there was
this new thing, Apple,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.070
which started out as small
as Joe&#39;s Shoe Store and

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.150
then, like, turns into this
giant mega-company.

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:27.220
But they weren&#39;t designed
for that world.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.112
And, like, they&#39;re good at
what they&#39;re good at,

00:34:29.112 --> 00:34:30.247
they should just be, do that
and

00:34:30.247 --> 00:34:31.807
screw this whole
entrepreneurship thing,

00:34:31.807 --> 00:34:33.390
just cuz it&#39;s cool.

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.240
Yes?
&gt;&gt; You said, management

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.850
is a problem that you have
only when you&#39;re successful.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.220
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So what about those first

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.520
two or three people as

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.510
a founder that you&#39;re trying
to manage?

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, so management is a
problem only if

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.910
you&#39;re successful.

00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:47.960
What about those first two
or three people?

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.320
Well, ideally, you&#39;re
successful before you

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.270
even hire two or three
people, right?

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.380
Didn&#39;t you say, Sam, that
Airbnb took five months to

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.318
hire their first employee?

00:34:59.318 --> 00:35:02.340
So ideally, you don&#39;t have
even two or

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.440
three people for quite a
while.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:10.008
When you do, you can, you
can sort of, the,

00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:15.780
the first hires in a startup
are almost like founders.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.500
They should be motivated by
the same things.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.750
They can&#39;t be people, they
can&#39;t be people you have to,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.750
like, manage, right?

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.380
This is like that, this is
not, like, The Office or

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.280
something like that.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.670
These are your, these have
to be your peers, really.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.180
You shouldn&#39;t have to manage
them much.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.040
&gt;&gt; So it&#39;s just a big no-no,
like if someone has to

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:39.080
be managed, no way they can
be on the founding team?

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.200
&gt;&gt; Well, never say never.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.350
I should repeat all these
questions, so

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.460
if someone has to manage,

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.570
no way they should be on the
founding team?

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.115
In, in the case where you&#39;re
doing something where you

00:35:49.115 --> 00:35:52.369
need some sort of super
advanced technical thing.

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:55.437
And there&#39;s some boffin, if
you know that word,

00:35:55.437 --> 00:35:58.431
who knows this thing and
nothing else in the world

00:35:58.431 --> 00:36:00.933
including, like how to wipe
his mouth.

00:36:00.933 --> 00:36:04.074
Then it may be to your
advantage to hire said

00:36:04.074 --> 00:36:07.300
boffin and wipe his mouth
for him.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.008
But.

00:36:08.008 --> 00:36:09.724
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:36:09.724 --> 00:36:12.980
&gt;&gt; As a general rule, you
want people who are,

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.620
sort of self-motivated early
on.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.340
They should be just like
founders.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.120
Yes, questions?

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.280
In the far back?

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.310
&gt;&gt; Do you think we&#39;re
currently in a bubble?

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.860
&gt;&gt; Do I think we&#39;re
currently in a bubble?

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:32.620
Okay, so I&#39;ll give you two
answers to this question.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.775
One, ask me questions that
are useful to this audience,

00:36:35.775 --> 00:36:37.260
cuz these people are here to
learn how to

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.120
start startups and I have in
my head, like,

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.080
more data about that than
anybody else.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.890
And you&#39;re asking me the
kind of questions a reporter

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.864
does cuz they can&#39;t think of
anything interesting to ask.

00:36:44.864 --> 00:36:48.970
But I will answer your
question.

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:51.990
There is a difference
between prices merely being

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.280
high and a bubble.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.720
A bubble is a very specific
form of prices being high,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.900
where people knowingly pay
high prices for

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.340
something in the hope that
they will be able to

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.640
unload it later on some
greater fool.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.230
Right?
And

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.120
that&#39;s what happened in the
late 90s.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.030
Like, VCs knowingly invested
in bullshit startups,

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.960
thinking that they would be

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.270
able to take those things
public, and unload them onto

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:16.240
the retail investors before
everything blew up.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.330
And I was there, I was there
for

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.440
that, at the epicenter of it
all.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.440
And that is not what&#39;s
happening today.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.900
Prices are high, valuations
are high.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.200
But valuations being high
does not mean a bubble.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.560
Every, every commodity has
prices that go up and

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.740
down in some sort of sine
wave.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.050
Definitely, prices are high.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.950
And so we tell people, if
you raise money, don&#39;t think

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.090
the next time you raise
money it&#39;s gonna be so easy.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.520
Who knows, maybe between now
and

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.090
then the Chinese economy
will have exploded and

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.110
there&#39;s another giant
disastrous recession.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:51.814
Who knows, assume the worst,
but bubble, no.

00:37:51.814 --> 00:37:53.000
Yes?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.728
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m noticing a trend
among young people and

00:37:55.728 --> 00:37:59.120
successful entrepreneurs,
where they don&#39;t want to

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.037
start one more great
company,

00:38:01.037 --> 00:38:02.892
they want to start like 20.

00:38:02.892 --> 00:38:05.751
And so you&#39;re starting to
see the rise of these labs

00:38:05.751 --> 00:38:08.611
attempts where they&#39;re gonna
try to launch a bunch

00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:09.440
of stuff.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.130
I don&#39;t know a really
stellar example yet but.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.150
&gt;&gt; Like ideal?

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.890
&gt;&gt; No like, like Idea lab,
like new one.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.007
There&#39;s
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah yeah.

00:38:22.007 --> 00:38:25.723
So there&#39;s this new thing
where people start labs that

00:38:25.723 --> 00:38:29.830
are supposed to spin off
startups, it might work.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.940
That&#39;s how Twitter started.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.570
In fact I meant Ideo Lab,

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.280
not Idea, that was another
Freudian slip.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.640
Because Twitter was not
Twitter at first.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.409
Twitter was the side
project.

00:38:41.409 --> 00:38:44.525
Side project at a company
called Ideo that was

00:38:44.525 --> 00:38:47.560
supposed to be in the
podcasting business.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.916
You&#39;re like podcasting
business,

00:38:48.916 --> 00:38:50.760
do those words even
grammatically fit together?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.390
The answer turned out to be
no, as Evan discovered.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.110
But like as a side project
they spun off Twitter and

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.340
boy was that a dog wagging
tail.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.162
So people are starting these
things that are supposed to

00:39:03.162 --> 00:39:05.130
spin off startups, will it
work?

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.780
Quite possibly, quite
possibly,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.950
if the right people do it.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.720
You can&#39;t do it yet

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.380
though, cuz you have to do
it with your own money.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.530
Yes, far back?

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.700
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.648
I hate to step into sort of
a gendered pitfall, but

00:39:17.648 --> 00:39:19.191
what advice do you have for

00:39:19.191 --> 00:39:21.940
female cofounders as they
pursuing funding?

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.570
&gt;&gt; Female cofounders when
you&#39;re pursuing funding,

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.720
well it probably is true
that women have

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.510
a harder time raising money,
right?

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.632
I&#39;ve noticed this in
empirically, and,

00:39:31.632 --> 00:39:34.760
Jessica is just about to
publish a bunch of

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.410
interviews with female
founders.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.813
And a lot of them said that
they thought they had

00:39:38.813 --> 00:39:41.810
a hard time, a harder time
raising money too.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.443
So, what I would, you
remember I said,

00:39:44.443 --> 00:39:46.642
like the way to raise money?

00:39:46.642 --> 00:39:49.020
Make your startup actually
do well.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.720
Well, that&#39;s just especially
true in that case.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.600
If have any, if you, if you
miss the ideal target

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.270
from the VC&#39;s point of view
in any respect, the way to

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.790
solve that problem is make
the startup do really well.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.710
So in fact, there was a
point like a year or

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.510
two ago when I tweeted this
growth graph of this

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.100
company and I didn&#39;t say who
they were.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.670
But I knew it would start
people asking and

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:13.230
it was actually a female
founded startup that was

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.400
having trouble raising money
but

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.110
their growth graphs were
stupendous.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.361
And so I tweeted it, knowing
that, like, all these VC&#39;s

00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:21.660
would start asking me who is
that, right?

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:24.090
And, like, growth graphs
have no gender, right?

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.690
So if they see the growth
graph first,

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:26.720
let them fall in love with
that.

00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:29.710
Right?

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.959
So do well, which is good
advice for

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:32.021
startups generally.

00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:32.909
Yes?

00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:34.523
&gt;&gt; What would you learn in
college right now?

00:40:34.523 --> 00:40:35.152
&gt;&gt; What?

00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:36.973
&gt;&gt; What would you learn in
college right now?

00:40:36.973 --> 00:40:40.179
&gt;&gt; What would I learn in
college?

00:40:40.179 --> 00:40:44.600
Hm, literary theory?

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.270
No, just kidding.

00:40:47.276 --> 00:40:49.622
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s see, well, you
know,

00:40:49.622 --> 00:40:53.810
honestly, I think I might
try and study physics.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.110
I feel that&#39;s the thing I
feel like I missed.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.570
For some reason, like, I was
all excited,

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.980
when I was a kid, computers
were the thing,

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.200
maybe they still are, right?

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.740
So I sort of got very
excited about writing code.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.490
And you could do things
with, you could do,

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.550
you could write real
programs in your bedroom.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.750
You can&#39;t like, build real
linear accelerators.

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.390
Well maybe you can, so
maybe, physics.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.140
I feel kind of,

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.990
I always, I have this, I
sort of look lon,

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.150
I notice I sort of look
longingly at physics.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:23.540
So maybe.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.540
But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s,
what am I saying?

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.910
I&#39;m saying, I was about to
say, I don&#39;t know if

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.760
that&#39;s going to be helpful
starting a startup and

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.550
I&#39;ve just told you to follow
you own curiosity!

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:32.770
So who cares if it&#39;s
helpful?

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:33.850
It&#39;ll turn out to be
helpful.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:35.820
Questions?

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.906
&gt;&gt; Another question online,

00:41:36.906 --> 00:41:38.794
what are your recurring
systems in your work and

00:41:38.794 --> 00:41:40.407
personal life that make you
efficient?

00:41:40.407 --> 00:41:42.815
Oh, boy, Ookay.

00:41:42.815 --> 00:41:45.524
So what are my recurring
systems in my work and

00:41:45.524 --> 00:41:47.890
personal life that make me
efficient?

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.390
Well, having kids is a good
way to be efficient.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.350
Cuz you have no time left,
so if you wanna get anything

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.480
done, the amount of done you
do per time is high.

00:42:01.387 --> 00:42:04.070
&gt;&gt; So, actually many
parents, many startup

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.150
founders who have kids have
made that point explicitly.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.340
It causes you to focus,
because you have no choice.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.473
Let&#39;s see but that&#39;s not, I
wouldn&#39;t actually recommend

00:42:15.473 --> 00:42:20.301
you having kids, just to
have you more focused so,

00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:25.450
let&#39;s see, you know, I don&#39;t
think I&#39;m very efficient.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.450
I have two ways of getting
work done.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.950
One is, like, during Y
Combinator,

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:30.380
the way I worked on Y
Combinator was,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.080
I was forced to, right?

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:32.980
Like, there was just,

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.530
I had to set the application
deadline.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.250
And then people would apply,
and then there would be

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.570
all of these applications
that I&#39;d have to

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.670
respond to by a certain
time, so I had to read them.

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:41.560
And I knew if I

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:43.630
read them badly we would get
bad startups, so

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.370
I tried really hard to read
them well, right?

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:48.930
So I set up this situation
that forced me to work.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.770
The other kind of work I do
is like writing essays.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.138
And I do that involuntarily.

00:42:53.138 --> 00:42:55.100
I&#39;m like walking down the
street and

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.445
the essay starts writing
itself in my head.

00:42:57.445 --> 00:43:01.593
And so really I either force
myself to work on

00:43:01.593 --> 00:43:04.059
less exciting things or,

00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:09.216
I can&#39;t help working on
exciting things, and I don&#39;t

00:43:09.216 --> 00:43:15.160
have any useful techniques
for making myself efficient.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.584
Sorry.

00:43:16.584 --> 00:43:18.427
If you work on things you
like you don&#39;t have to

00:43:18.427 --> 00:43:19.850
force yourself to be
efficient.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.227
Yes?
&gt;&gt; When do you think is

00:43:21.227 --> 00:43:24.570
a good time to turn a side
project into a startup?

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:25.410
&gt;&gt; When is a good time to

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.520
turn a side project into a
startup?

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.328
You will know.

00:43:28.328 --> 00:43:29.277
Right?

00:43:29.277 --> 00:43:31.933
&gt;&gt; What do has the
properties

00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:34.247
&gt;&gt; It starts, you,

00:43:34.247 --> 00:43:35.294
you when you okay,

00:43:35.294 --> 00:43:37.782
the question is when you
turn a startup into,

00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.747
a side project into a real
startup.

00:43:39.747 --> 00:43:42.628
You will know that it&#39;s
becoming a real startup when

00:43:42.628 --> 00:43:44.789
it takes over an alarming
percentage of

00:43:44.789 --> 00:43:45.922
your life, right?

00:43:45.922 --> 00:43:48.268
Like when you find like, my
God, I&#39;ve just spent all day

00:43:48.268 --> 00:43:50.158
working on this thing that&#39;s
supposed to be

00:43:50.158 --> 00:43:52.270
a side project, I&#39;m gonna
fail all my classes.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:53.390
What am I gonna do?

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:54.310
Right?

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.070
Then maybe it&#39;s turning into
a startup.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:58.120
Yes?
Wait, I already answered

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.970
your question.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.590
I should ask, I should let
somebody else ask one.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.690
I may get back to you.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:02.200
Yes?

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.997
&gt;&gt; I, I know you talked a
lot earlier about

00:44:03.997 --> 00:44:06.350
you&#39;ll know when you start
doing extremely well.

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:07.838
But I feel like in a lot of
cases,

00:44:07.838 --> 00:44:10.101
it&#39;s just you have a grey
line where it&#39;s like,

00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:11.865
hey you have some users but
maybe not as

00:44:11.865 --> 00:44:14.220
explosive growth chart as to
the right.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:14.970
What would you do?

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:16.660
Or what would you recommend
doing in those

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:18.490
situations specifically
allocating time and

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:21.020
resources, how do you
balance in?

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, when a startup is
sort of

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:23.615
growing but not much.

00:44:23.615 --> 00:44:25.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Didn&#39;t you tell them

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.970
they were supposed to redo
things that don&#39;t scale?

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:28.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You sir,

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:29.970
have not done the readings.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:31.620
&gt;&gt; And you are busted
therefore.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.090
Because I wrote a whole
essay in answer to

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.740
that question.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.610
That is it.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.010
Do things that don&#39;t scale.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.520
Just go read that.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.890
Cuz I can&#39;t remember
everything I said.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.139
&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s about exactly
that problem.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.780
&gt;&gt; Yes, back there.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.120
&gt;&gt; What kind of startup
should not go

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.170
through incubation, in your
opinion?

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.900
&gt;&gt; What kinda, you mean.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.640
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Do you mean

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.890
incubation YC?

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.140
&gt;&gt; No, yeah, YC or.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.910
&gt;&gt; What kind of startup
should not through YC.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.014
Definitely any that will
fail.

00:45:01.402 --> 00:45:04.096
&gt;&gt; And, or, if you&#39;ll
succeed but

00:45:04.096 --> 00:45:07.562
you&#39;re an intolerable person
that also,

00:45:07.562 --> 00:45:10.751
Sam would probably sooner do
without.

00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:13.039
Short of that, I cannot
think of any,

00:45:13.039 --> 00:45:15.400
because most, a large
percentage of,

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.834
founders are often surprised
by how large a percentage of

00:45:18.834 --> 00:45:22.196
the problems that startups
have are the same regardless

00:45:22.196 --> 00:45:24.796
of what kind of thing
they&#39;re working on.

00:45:24.796 --> 00:45:27.566
And those tend to be kind of
problems that YC helps with

00:45:27.566 --> 00:45:30.460
the most not the ones that
are domain specific.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.070
So I canâ€™t, is there, can
you think of,

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.990
class of startups that YC
wouldn&#39;t work for?

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.740
I can&#39;t.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.400
I mean like we had fission
and

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.190
fusion startups in the last
batch.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.170
Rather they had, yes?

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.030
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that it&#39;s
good advice to

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.750
learn a lot about something
that matters?

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.020
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Some good strategies to

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.970
figure out what matters?

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.710
&gt;&gt; Well, If you think of,

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.740
okay, so how do you figure
out what matters?

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.970
If you think of technology
as something that&#39;s

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.740
spreading as a sort of
fractal stain, anything on

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.690
the edge represents an
interesting idea.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:05.350
It sounds familiar.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.160
So how do you figure out
hmm?

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.850
Like I said, that was the
problem.

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:13.160
You have correctly
identified,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.900
the thing where I didn&#39;t
really answer the question,

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.810
where I gave this question
begging answer.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.650
I said, like I, just like,

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.950
I&#39;m interested in
interesting things.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.290
If you&#39;re interested in
interesting things,

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.919
work on them and things will
all work out, right?

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.620
But how do you tell what is
a real problem?

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.432
I don&#39;t know.

00:46:28.432 --> 00:46:29.520
That&#39;s like important enough
to

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.240
write a whole essay about,
and I don&#39;t know the answer.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.910
I probably should write
something about that.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:33.720
But I don&#39;t know!

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.270
I don&#39;t know.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:37.590
I figured out a technique
for

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.150
detecting whether you have a
taste for

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.690
genuinely interesting
problems, which is whether

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.540
you find working on boring
things intolerable, right?

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.450
And there are known boring
things,

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:49.000
like literary theory and

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.430
working in middle management
in some large company.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:52.970
So if you could tolerate
those things,

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:53.730
then you must not,

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.130
you must either have
stupendous self discipline,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.930
or you don&#39;t have a taste
for

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:01.740
genuinely interesting
problems, and vice versa.

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.244
Yes?
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:47:02.244 --> 00:47:04.899
&gt;&gt; Okay, one more question,
it better be good.

00:47:04.899 --> 00:47:08.075
&gt;&gt; I was wondering out, you
know like Snapchat, like,

00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:10.210
makes money
&gt;&gt; Snapchat?

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.124
What do I know about
Snapchat?

00:47:12.124 --> 00:47:15.069
&gt;&gt; We didn&#39;t fund them.

00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:18.380
How about another question?

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:19.100
All right go ahead.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.010
&gt;&gt; You talked about hiring
employees you like.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:26.170
But it seems like that could
read into a monoculture, and

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.190
there are a lot of benefits
in being a monoculture, but

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:31.220
how do you feel about the
blind spots that arise?

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if you hire
people who

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.070
you like you might get a
monoculture, and

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.700
how do you deal with the
blind spots that arise?

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.748
Starting a startup is

00:47:37.748 --> 00:47:40.370
something where many things
will be going wrong.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.240
You can&#39;t expect it to be
perfect, and

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.820
the advantages of hiring
people that you know and

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.350
like are far greater than,
you know,

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:51.070
the small disadvantages of
having some monoculture.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.050
You look at it empirically
all the most

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.020
successful startups someone
just like hires all

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.930
their pals out of college.

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:07.370
All right you guys, thank
you.

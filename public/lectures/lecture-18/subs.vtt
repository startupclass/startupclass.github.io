WEBVTT

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:06.621
General consul.

00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:08.010
&gt;&gt; Oops.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.260
&gt;&gt; Christine and Caroline.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.070
And they&#39;re going to talk
about finance and

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.400
legal mechanics for startups.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.460
This is certainly not the most
exciting of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.630
the classes, sorry.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.020
But if you get this right this
is probably the class that.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.990
So thank you very much for
coming, and yeah, go ahead.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.400
So like Sam said,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.790
this lecture is about the
mechanics of start up.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.850
And Kristi and I are going to
be talking about some of

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.385
the basic legal and accounting
issues that your

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:36.030
startup may face in the very
beginning.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.840
I was watching Paul Graham&#39;s
video, and at one

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.510
point he says, founders don&#39;t
need to know the mechanics of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.420
starting a startup.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.050
I thought, oh no,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.520
that&#39;s exactly what Sam titled
this lecture.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.020
&gt;&gt; Ha.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.200
&gt;&gt; But what PT actually says
is that founders don&#39;t need to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.730
know the mechanics in detail.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.000
Because it&#39;s very dangerous
for

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.560
founders to get bogged down in
the details.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.870
And that&#39;s exactly right.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.390
And Kirsten,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.520
I can&#39;t give you the details
in 45 minutes anyway.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.850
So our goal here today is to
make sure that you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.480
do know better than to form
your startup as a Florida LLC.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.330
&gt;&gt; So, as Sam mentioned, we
are also

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200
worrying this is going to be
pretty boring for you to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.510
listen to an accountant and a
lawyer talking about this.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.520
You know?
You&#39;ve had some really

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.050
amazing founders talking about
really interesting things.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.760
But like, like Sam said, you
know,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.250
this is the kind of stuff that
if you know the basics you can

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.740
get yourself set up in the
right way of always paying.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.130
Stop worrying about it and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.380
then concentrate on what you
actually want to do.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.850
Which is make your company a
success.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.170
And so, you know,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
we refer to this term startup
all the time.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.730
And probably in the back of
your head,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.640
you kind of know that by
startup we mean there has to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.600
be some legal entity.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.140
And that&#39;s, you know, kind of
separate legal entity.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.860
We&#39;ll talk a little bit more
about how we

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.720
actually set that up and what
that means to you.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.570
And you also probably know
that a startup will have

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.500
assets.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740
IP, inventions, other things.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.400
And that the company needs to
protect those.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.040
So we&#39;ll talk a little bit
more about that.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.580
About how to raise money
hiring employees, and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.790
entering into contracts.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.820
So there&#39;s a few other things
that talk, that you need

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.840
to talk about whilst your
setting up your company,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.200
which kind of ferrets out a
few issues amongst founders.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.130
Things like who&#39;s going to be
in charge and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.280
how much equity is everybody
going to own.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.210
So those are really good
things to talk about too.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.345
You know, we can switch
slides.

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:36.100
&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.690
This is us.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.610
Kirsti has the calculator.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.310
I have like, the geriatric
glasses,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.350
which is actually pretty fair.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.440
Okay, so

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.160
the first thing we&#39;re going to
talk about is formation.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.260
Kirsti actually just mentioned
that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
Your startup is going to be a
separate legal entity.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.280
And the, and you guys probably
already know this, but the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.250
primary purpose for forming a
separate legal entity is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.110
to protect yourselves from
personal liability.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.600
And what that means is, if
you&#39;re company ever gets sued

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.410
you know, it can&#39;t, it&#39;s not
your money in your

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.890
bank account that the, that
the person can take.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.770
It&#39;s the corporations.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.920
So that&#39;s why you form one.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.090
So then the question is, where
do you form one?

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.160
And theoretically you have 50
choices but

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.710
the easiest place is Delaware,
and

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.810
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all familiar
with that as well.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.040
But Delaware is in

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.210
the business of forming
corporations.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.230
The law there is very clear
and

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.390
very settled, it&#39;s the
standard.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.730
The other thing is that
investors are very

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.530
comfortable with Delaware.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.980
They already invest in
companies that

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.970
are Delaware corporations.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.500
Most of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.080
their investments are probably
Delaware corporations.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.730
So if you are also a Delaware
corporation then

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.320
everything just becomes much
more simple, right?

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.470
There&#39;s less diligence for the
investor to do.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.760
You don&#39;t have to have a
conversation about whether or

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.850
not to reincorporate your

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.410
Washington company into
Delaware.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.000
So there&#39;s a reason that so
many companies do it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.630
It&#39;s standard.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.430
It&#39;s familiar.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.200
So I&#39;ll tell you a story.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.430
We had a company at YC about
two years ago,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.580
that was originally formed as
an LLC in a state that I&#39;ll,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.920
that I&#39;ll say, Connecticut.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.080
The founders had some lawyer
friends there who said,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.730
this is the right way to do
it.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.400
And when they came to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.630
YC we said you guys need to
convert to Delaware.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.795
So the lawyers in Connecticut
did the conversion

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:29.910
paperwork and unfortunately
they didn&#39;t do it right.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.610
They made a very simple
mistake but

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.940
it was a very crucial mistake.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.760
The company was recently
raising money.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.210
Like a lot a lot of money and
this mistake was uncovered.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.030
That the basically the mistake
was this company thought it

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.180
was a Delaware corporation for
a couple years, but

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.870
in fact it was still a
Connecticut LLC.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.610
And I&#39;ll just say this four
different law

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.020
firms were needed to figure
that one out.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.860
Two in Delaware one in
Connecticut,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.305
one here in the Silicon Valley
and the bill right now is at

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:59.320
$500,000, for a conversion
mistake.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.000
So, so what&#39;s the takeaway
here, pretty simple.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.680
Keep it really simple and
familiar for yourself.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.250
The reason we incorporate all
companies the same way at

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.140
Y Combinator is because it&#39;s
easy.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.170
So don&#39;t get fancy.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.540
Just save yourself some time
and money.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So once you&#39;ve decided that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.180
you&#39;re going to be a Delaware
corporation,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.540
how do you actually set that
up?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.890
And it requires a few
different steps, but

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.610
the first one is actually
really easy.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.840
You literally just fax two
pieces of paper into

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.280
Delaware saying, we&#39;re
going to set up a corporation.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.160
All that does though is create
a shell of a company.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.940
It doesn&#39;t actually do
anything within the company.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.790
So after that,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.550
you then need to complete a
set of documents that

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.500
among other things approve the
bylaws of the company.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.870
It creates a board of
directors,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.980
it creates offices of the
company.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.110
Delaware requires that
somebody has the title of

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.510
CEO or president, and of
secretary.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.990
So also at this point,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.730
you need to complete documents
that assign any inventions or

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.380
any code or anything that you
as an individual create,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.520
so that the company actually
owns that.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.500
And remember at this point,
it&#39;s,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.550
it&#39;s a really good thing to
think about.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.510
You as founders have to

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.520
think about things in two
different ways.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.280
You always have to be
thinking,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.250
am I doing this as an
individual?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.080
As me?

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.600
Or am I doing this on behalf
of the company,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.260
which is a separate entity.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.020
So you have to maintain that
split in

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.760
your mind going through all of
this.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.260
And we&#39;ll talk more about
where that comes in

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.980
a little bit later.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.090
So there are services that can
help you get incorporated,

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.980
of course you can use a law
firm but there are also

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.540
other online services that
help, and the one we often use

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.620
with a lot of the YC companies
is call Clearkie Clearkie.com.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.610
And they are set up so

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.650
that all the standard, basic
documents are used and

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.530
they get you set up in a very
vanilla way.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.270
So that you can just move on
and

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.590
keep, keep focusing on what
you need to do.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.565
So a note on paperwork.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.180
You&#39;re creating documents.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.290
These are really important
documents that are going to be

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.390
affecting what the company
does, and what the company is.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.960
So it&#39;s really, really
important that you

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.770
actually keep these signed
documents in a safe place.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.260
And it sounds so basic, but we
get so

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.000
many founders coming to us
saying oh, I don&#39;t know.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.250
These, these, some documents.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.120
And they have no idea what
they are or where they are.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.770
So really, really make sure
that you keep them in

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:28.430
a safe place.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.360
And let&#39;s be, let&#39;s be honest,
this is not the glamorous part

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.210
of running a startup, you
know, filing documents.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.890
But actually at

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.230
the times where this is
crucial are going to

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.050
be at really high stress times
in the startup&#39;s life.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.460
It&#39;s likely to be if the
company&#39;s raising a big

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.590
series A round, or if the
company&#39;s being acquired.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.760
The company will have to go
through due diligence, and

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.430
there will be lawyers asking
for all this stuff.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.520
And if you don&#39;t have it and
you don&#39;t know where it is,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.660
it&#39;s just making a really
stressful situation even

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.410
more stressful.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.940
So really, the, you know, the
key thing here is,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.470
like we say, keep it simple,
but

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.180
keep those documents in a safe
place and keep it organized.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.830
It will make your life so much
easier.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.750
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So now,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.420
we&#39;re going to talk about
equity.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.590
And we&#39;re going to touch on a
couple of

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.640
different things in this
section.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.600
The first thing that

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.980
we&#39;re going to talk about is
equity allocation.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.760
So what am I talking about
here?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.000
I&#39;m talking about.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.850
If your company stock is a
pie,

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.450
you&#39;re talking about how to
divide the pie and

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.280
you&#39;re talking about this with
your cofounders.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.890
Why is this important?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.630
Well if you&#39;re a solo founder,
this really isn&#39;t important.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.770
But if you are a team of two
or

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.060
more than this issue is
absolutely critical.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.650
So the first thing that you
need to know is that

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.350
execution had greater value
than the idea.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.870
What do I mean by that?

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.130
A lot of founder teams give
way too much credit and

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.990
therefore a lot of the
company&#39;s equity to the person

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.040
who came up with the idea for
the company.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.570
And ideas are obviously very
important but

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.330
they have zero value.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.520
Who&#39;s ever heard of a billion
dollar payment for

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.280
just an idea.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.860
So value is really created
when the whole founder team

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.160
works together to execute on
an idea.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.780
And so you need to resist the
urge to

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.780
give a disproportionate amount
of stock to the founder who is

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.050
credited with coming up for
the idea for the company.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.720
The next thing you want to
think about is, okay, so

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.620
how much stock, or

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.509
should the stock be allocated
equally among the founders?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.250
And from our perspective, the
simple answer is probably yes.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.300
Our mantra at Y Combinator is
that

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.870
stock allocation doesn&#39;t have
to be exactly equal, but

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.190
if it&#39;s very disproportionate,
that&#39;s a huge red flag for us.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.280
We wonder what conversation is
not happening in,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.200
among the founder team when
the ownership isn&#39;t equal.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.990
For example, is one founder
secretly thinking that this

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.720
whole startup thing is
temporary?

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.390
Is one founder over inflating
the work that he or

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.680
she has already done on the
company or

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.900
over inflating his or her
education or prior experience?

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.950
Do the founders really trust
each other and have they

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.690
been honest with each other
about their expectations for

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.970
this startup and for the
future?

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.000
So when ownership is
disproportionate,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.830
what we worry about is

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.697
that the founders are not in
sync with one another.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.173
Thirdly it&#39;s really important
to look forward in

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:25.979
the startup and now backwards.

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:29.997
Instead another way all the
founders in it 100%?

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:32.655
Are they in it for the long
haul?

00:10:32.655 --> 00:10:35.737
If the expectation at your
startup is that each founder

00:10:35.737 --> 00:10:38.886
is in it 100% and you&#39;re all
in it for the long haul,

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:41.968
then everything that happened
before the formation of

00:10:41.968 --> 00:10:44.410
the company shouldn&#39;t matter.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.830
It doesn&#39;t matter who thought
of the idea.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.650
It doesn&#39;t matter who did the
coding, or

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.110
who built the prototype, or
which one has an MBA.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.290
It will feel better to the
whole team if

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.430
the allocation is equal,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.210
because the whole team is
necessary for execution.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.030
So, here&#39;s the take away on
this point.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.950
In the top YC companies, which
we call those, you know,

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.810
with the highest evaluations,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.560
there are zero instances where
the founders have

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.920
had significantly
disproportionate equity split.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.800
&gt;&gt; Alright, so you&#39;ve had the
conversation about how to

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.790
split the equity.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.410
But then what?

00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:22.599
again, we talked to many
founders who

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:25.411
were actually surprised that
they have to do something in

00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.862
order to own this stock.

00:11:26.862 --> 00:11:29.442
They think about, they think
that talking about this is,

00:11:29.442 --> 00:11:31.234
is actually enough.

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:33.929
And this again is another
situation where you have to

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:35.704
think about you as an
individual,

00:11:35.704 --> 00:11:38.650
versus you as a representative
of the company.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.930
And if you, if you equate this
to a large company,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.720
you know if you, if you worked
at Google and

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.090
you were told as part of your
compensation package,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.410
that you would be receiving
some shares,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.180
you would expect to sign
something to get those shares.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.360
And if you didn&#39;t, you&#39;d be
thinking,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.930
oh what&#39;s going on here?

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.820
Well, it&#39;s the same thing
with,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.310
with a small company as well.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.340
So in this case the paper,
the, the documents that

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.920
you&#39;re signing is a stock
purchase agreement.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.380
So you as an individual, buy
the shares from the company.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.060
And in any situation, if
you&#39;re buying something,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.460
there&#39;s a two-way transaction
where you pay for

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.199
something and you get
something in return.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.870
And in this case you&#39;re
getting shares in return for

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.520
either a cash payment, or for
contributing IP, or

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.290
inventions, or code to the
company, so that the company

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.990
actually owns everything that
you&#39;ve done in the past.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.970
So, we also refer to that
stock being restricted

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.340
because it vests over time.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.750
And we&#39;re going to cover that
next in more detail.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.500
But, as a result of the stock
being restricted investing,

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.140
there&#39;s one very very crucial
piece of paper.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.640
That we talk about until we&#39;re
blue in the face to everybody,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.270
because there&#39;s actually no
way to go back and fix this.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.440
And this is actually one of
the things that,

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.940
because there&#39;s no, there&#39;s no
way to fix this,

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.140
this has blown up deals in the
past.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.864
We&#39;ve, we&#39;ve seen companies
where, because they haven&#39;t

00:13:06.864 --> 00:13:10.736
filed what&#39;s called an 83 b
election deals have blown up.

00:13:10.736 --> 00:13:13.888
And I&#39;m not going to go into
detail about what that 83 b

00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:15.767
election is actually about,
but

00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:18.854
just leave it as it affects
your individual taxes, and

00:13:18.854 --> 00:13:21.360
it affects the company&#39;s
taxes.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.806
And so, it can have a big
impact.

00:13:23.806 --> 00:13:27.010
So, you know, here we have the
main,

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.390
the main things here are sign
the paperwork.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.200
Sign the, sign the stock
purchase agreement,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.920
sign the 83 b election, and
make sure that you

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.920
actually have proof that you
sent that in.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.410
Because if you don&#39;t have the
proof,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.770
it just goes into a black hole
at the IRS, and

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.540
investors and acquirers will
walk away from a deal if

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.430
you can&#39;t prove that.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.090
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.653
So the next thing we&#39;re going
to talk about is vesting.

00:13:51.653 --> 00:13:54.983
And I imagine that many of you
are familiar with what

00:13:54.983 --> 00:13:56.610
vesting is.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.560
But just in case,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.010
really simply vesting means
that you get full ownership of

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.470
your stock over a specific
period of time.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.929
So we&#39;re talking about the
stock that Chrissie just said,

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.080
you bought your stock of your
company, and

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.460
you own it and you get to vote
it.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.610
But if you leave before this
vesting period is over,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.350
then the company can get some
of those unvested shares back.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.400
So and I&#39;m just going to, just
so you guys know the other

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.660
ways to refer to vesting,
you&#39;ll hear restricted stock.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.360
That means that,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.260
that stock that&#39;s subject to
vesting, the IRS speak for

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.100
this is, shares that are
subject to forfeiture.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.620
So, so, it&#39;s a little
terminology there.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.520
okay.
So,

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.480
what should a typical vesting
period be?

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.250
In Silicon Valley, the
so-called standard vesting

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.090
period is four years with a
one year cliff.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.350
This means that after one
year, the founder vests in or

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.840
fully owns, 25% of the shares.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.820
Then the remaining shares vest
monthly over the next

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.450
three years.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.390
So here&#39;s an example.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.140
Founder buys stock on
Christmas Day, let&#39;s say, and

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.940
then quits the company on the
following Thanksgiving, so

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.020
before the year is passed.

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.690
In that case, the founder
leaves with zero shares,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.370
right, cliff period hasn&#39;t
been met.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.900
If the founder though, quits
the day after the next

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.240
Christmas, so a year and a day
later, he or

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.770
she&#39;s vested in exactly 25% of
the shares, right?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.520
In that case, the one year
cliff has been met.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.116
So, what happens to the shares
when a co,

00:15:27.116 --> 00:15:29.280
when a founder stops working
at the company?

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.630
Company can repurchase those
shares.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.300
An example I just gave, where
the founder quit, a year and

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.790
a day after purchasing the
shares,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.450
75% of those shares are still
invested.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.010
And the company will
repurchase all the,

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.590
that full 75% of those shares
from the founder.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.780
How?

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.310
Just writes the founder a
check.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.910
That&#39;s how the founder bought
it, right?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.660
So, it&#39;s the same price per
share that the founder paid,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.270
and it&#39;s really just

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.760
giving the founder his or her
money back.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.840
So then the question is, why
would you have vesting?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.015
Why would founders do this to
themselves, right?

00:16:02.015 --> 00:16:03.420
because it&#39;s just the founders
they&#39;re,

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.180
they&#39;re doing this on their
own shares.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.100
Doing this to their own
shares.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.830
So, and probably the number
one reason why vesting is

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.530
important has to do with
founders leaving the company.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.530
So without, say you didn&#39;t
have vesting and

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.270
a founder leaves, a huge chunk
of the equity ownership leaves

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.300
with a him, him or her.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.740
And obviously that is not fair
to the founders left behind.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.120
And we&#39;re actually going to
talk about this a little bit

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.020
more when we get to the
founder employment slide,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.750
I&#39;ll go into that in more
detail.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.560
But the other reason to have
vesting is the concept of

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.840
skin in the game.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.430
The idea that founders need to
be incentivized,

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.902
to keep working on their start
up.

00:16:42.902 --> 00:16:45.570
If a founder can walk away
with his or

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.240
her full ownership at any
point in time, then why would

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.010
you stay and grind away, start
ups are hard.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:57.410
So do single founders need
vesting?

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.950
They do, and the reason is
because the skin in the game

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.060
concept applies to solo
founders as well.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.320
And investors really want to
see all founders, even

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.030
solo founders incentivized to
stay at the company for

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.580
a long time.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.770
And the other reason that
single founder should put

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.900
vesting on their shares is to
set an example for employees.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.100
Because you can imagine it
would be, you know,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.760
inappropriate for a founder to
tell an employee that he or

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.790
she has to have four year
vesting on his or her shares.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.120
But the founder doesn&#39;t think
that he or

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.490
she needs any on their own
shares.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:30.370
It&#39;s really a culture point.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.860
A founder who has vesting on
his or

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.540
her shares, then sets the,
sets the tone for

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.420
the company, saying, we&#39;re all
in it for the long haul.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.530
We all have vesting on our
shares,

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.340
we&#39;re doing this together.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.430
So, what are the takeaways
from here?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.140
I would say vesting alliance
incentives among the founders,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.470
if they all have to stick it
out and

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.760
grow the company before any of
them get any of that company.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.660
And then number two,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.150
investors don&#39;t want to put
money in a company where

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.500
the founders can quit whenever
they feel like it and still

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.690
have a big equity ownership
stake in that company.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, so moving on.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.920
We&#39;ve now got a beautifully
formed corporation

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.800
in Delaware.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.860
Everybody&#39;s got their stock.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.530
It&#39;s all the, the plain
vanilla standard paperwork.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.850
So, so then what?

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.760
You know, probably the next
stage of a company&#39;s life

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.460
is needing to raise some
money.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.190
So we&#39;re going to, we&#39;re going
to talk a bit more about that.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.200
And you, and, you know,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.210
we know that you&#39;ve already
heard a lot from investors and

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.780
from founders already in, in
this set of classes.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.430
And they&#39;ve been talking much
more around the tactics and

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.050
how to raise money but, what
about the paperwork?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.990
What about when somebody
actually agrees to

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.320
invest, then what?

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.010
So, first of all in terms of
logistics,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.960
in very simple terms there are
two ways to raise money.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.000
So, either the price is set
for

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.650
what the, the money that comes
in or the price isn&#39;t set.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.380
And by price, we mean the
valuation of the company it&#39;s,

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.560
it&#39;s the same things.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.220
So rounds can&#39;t actually be
called anything people can,

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.430
can name them whatever they
want.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.852
But generally if you hear the
term,

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:07.330
seed round, it would mean that
the price has not been set,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.920
and anything that&#39;s a Series A
or a Series B,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.920
would be something where the
price has been set.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.720
So not setting the price is
the most straightforward,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.280
fast route to getting money.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.980
And usually the way that this
is done is through convertible

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.640
notes or safes.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.050
And, again this is a two way
transaction.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.380
So, there&#39;s a piece of paper
that says, for

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.290
example, that an investor is
paying $100,000 now.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.350
And in return, has the right
to receive stock at a future

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.520
date when the price is set by
investors in a priced round.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.280
So it&#39;s important to note that
at, at the time the paper work

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.360
is set, that investor is not a
shareholder, and

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.260
therefore doesn&#39;t have any
voting rights on the company.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.030
They will have some other
rights which Carolynn is

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.250
going to talk about
separately.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.810
Of course, investors want
something in return for

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.030
putting in money at the
earliest,

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.790
ie riskiest, stage of the
companies life.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.580
And this is where the concept
of evaluation cap comes in,

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.080
which I&#39;m sure many of you
have heard mentioned before.

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:20.560
So usually the documents for
an un,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.980
unpriced round set a cap for
the conversion into shares.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.750
And that&#39;s not the current
valuation of the company

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.880
it&#39;s actually an upper bound
on the valuation used in

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.813
future to use used in future
to calculate how

00:20:35.813 --> 00:20:37.442
many shares that investor is
going to get.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.570
So, for an example, an
investor that invests $100,000

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.452
on a safe with a $5 million
cap.

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:50.428
Then a year later the company
raises a priced round with

00:20:50.428 --> 00:20:54.546
evaluation of, let&#39;s say $20
million.

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.403
And then the early investor
would have a much,

00:20:57.403 --> 00:21:00.548
much lower price per share,
about a quarter.

00:21:00.548 --> 00:21:04.650
And therefore that $100,000
would buy them approximately.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:08.326
Four times more shares than an
investor that was coming in

00:21:08.326 --> 00:21:12.720
and putting in 100,000 in that
Series A priced round.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.290
So that&#39;s where they get
their, their reward for

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.030
being in early.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.760
So again, this is another
situation where you need to

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.140
make sure you have the signed
documents and you,

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.070
you know where they are,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.170
because different investors
may have different rights.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.840
And so you need to know what
those things are.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.710
And again services like Clerky
can, can help with that.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.470
They have very standard
documents that most of

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.180
our YC companies use to raise
money on.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.780
A couple of other things to
think about when

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.490
you are raising money.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.970
Hopefully you&#39;ve got a really
hot company that&#39;s,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.680
that&#39;s doing great and it&#39;s
really easy to raise money.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.070
But you should be aware that
all

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.020
these people throwing money at
you does have some downsides.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.260
So the first thing is to
understand your

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.100
future dilution.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.630
So if you raise, let&#39;s say,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:10.340
$2 million on safes with a
valuation cap of $6 million.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.010
Then when those safes convert
into equity, those early

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.110
investors are going to own
about 25% of the company.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.230
And that&#39;s going to be in
addition to the investors that

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.630
are coming in at that priced
round,

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.650
who may want to own 20% of the
company.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.760
So you&#39;ve already at that
point given away 45% of

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.681
the company.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.130
So is this really what you
want?

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.310
And, you know, the answer
might be yes.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.740
Remember that some money on a
low valuation cap

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.800
is infinitely better than no
money at all.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.240
And if those are the terms
that you can get,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.600
then, then take that money.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.600
But it&#39;s just something to be
aware of,

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.350
and to follow through the
whole process, so that you can

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.220
see where this is going to
lead you down the road.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.940
The other thing to bear in
mind is that the invest,

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.340
investors should be
sophisticated.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.460
And by that we mean that they,
they have enough money to be

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.230
able to invest and that they,
they understand that

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.290
investing in startups is a
risky business.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.140
You know we, we see so many
companies coming into us that

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.120
say, oh yeah, my, my uncle put
money in, or my neighbor put

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.210
money in, and they&#39;ve put in
$5 or $10,000 each.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.870
And often, those are the
investors that

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.930
cause the most problems going
forward,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.090
because they don&#39;t understand
how this is a long term game.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.321
And so, you know, they get to
the point where they&#39;re

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:37.482
sitting, thinking hm, I could
actually do with that

00:23:37.482 --> 00:23:39.889
money back because I need a
new kitchen.

00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:40.909
Or, you know this,

00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:43.610
this startup investing is not
actually as exciting as

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.430
all the TV shows and movies
made it out to be.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.578
So, and those, those cause
problems to the company,

00:23:48.578 --> 00:23:51.114
you know, if they&#39;re, they&#39;re
asking for their money back.

00:23:51.114 --> 00:23:53.850
So, just be aware that, that
you should really be

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.719
getting money from people who
are sophisticated and

00:23:56.719 --> 00:23:58.233
know what they&#39;re doing.

00:23:58.233 --> 00:24:01.316
And the term that you&#39;ll hear
that, that refers to

00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:04.620
these people are that they are
accredited investors.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.570
So really the main,

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.920
the main points here is keep
it simple, raise your

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.790
money using standard documents
keep, make sure that you have

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.640
people who understand what
they&#39;re getting into,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.340
and understand what you&#39;re
getting into in terms of

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.110
future dilution.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.140
So you&#39;re raising money, you
understand what you&#39;re

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.270
selling, you figured out the
price,

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.120
you&#39;ve got down the logistics
that Kirstie just described.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.190
But what you may find is that
you don&#39;t understand some of

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.480
the terms and terminology that
your investors are using.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.670
And this okay, but

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.980
you have a burden to go figure
that stuff out.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.410
Don&#39;t assume that just because
you&#39;ve agreed on the valuation

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.330
of the price that all the
other stuff doesn&#39;t matter,

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.750
because it does matter, and
you need to know how these

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.805
terms are going to impact your
company in the long run.

00:24:54.805 --> 00:24:58.070
At Y Combinator Chris and

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.770
I hear founders say all the
time, I didn&#39;t know

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.350
what that was, I didn&#39;t know
what I was signing, you know?

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.850
I, I didn&#39;t know I agreed to
that.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.650
So, really, the burden is on
you to figure this,

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:07.690
to figure this stuff out.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.510
And we&#39;re going to go over
four common investor requests.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.800
So, the first one is, board
seat.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.200
Some investors will ask for

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.840
a seat on your company&#39;s board
of directors.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.920
And the investor usually wants
to be a director,

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.840
either because he or

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.560
she really wants to keep tabs
on their money.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.770
Or because he or

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.500
she really thinks they can
help you run your business.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.050
And you have to be

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:30.630
really careful about adding an
investor to your board.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.900
In most cases, you want to say
no.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.240
Otherwise, make sure it&#39;s

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.060
a person who&#39;s really going to
add value.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.660
Having money is very valuable,
but someone who really helps

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.450
with strategy and direction is
priceless, so choose wisely.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.240
The other thing, is advisors.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.850
There are so many people who
want to give advice to

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.895
startups, and so few people
who actually give good advice.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.150
Once an investor has given
your company money,

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.510
that person should be a
defacto advisor.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.380
But without any official
title, and

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.290
more importantly without the
company having to

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.835
give anything extra in return
for the advice.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.110
So here&#39;s an example.

00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:13.440
At Y Combinator we&#39;ve noticed
that

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.440
whenever a startup manages to
garner a celebrity investor,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.880
the celebrity almost always
asks to be an advisor.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.330
We have a company that
provides on demand bodyguard

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.980
services, and an MBA
basketball player invested.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.840
Ask to be an advisor, and then
asked to be given shares of

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.570
common stock in exchange for
the advisor services.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.670
And the services that this
person had in mind,

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.270
this investor had in mind,
would be to introduce his

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.120
company around to all the
other professional basketball

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.319
players who might want to use
an on demand bodyguard.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.040
But, this celebrity just made
a big investment.

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.150
Shouldn&#39;t he want to help the
company succeed anyway?

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.290
Why does he need something
extra?

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.740
All investors who can help,
should do so.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.300
Asking for additional shares
is

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.860
just an investor looking for a
freebie.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.800
Okay, next we&#39;re going to talk
about pro-rata rights.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.090
What are pro-rata rights.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.490
Some of you may have heard of
this before.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.540
But, very simply its the right
to maintain your

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.030
percentage ownership in a
company by buying more shares

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.585
in the company in the future.

00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:17.920
Pro-rata rights are a way to
avoid dilution, and

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.350
dilution in this context means
owning less and

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.460
less of the company each time
the company sells more stock

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.340
to other investors.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.640
So, this is a really basic
example but,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.370
say an early investor buys
shares of preferred stock and

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.980
ends up owning 3% of the
company once the financing

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.830
has closed.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.210
And the company raises another
round of financing, and

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.890
the company will go to this
investor who negotiated and

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:44.290
got pro-rata rights and say,
hey, we&#39;re raising more money.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.170
So you&#39;re welcome to buy,

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.050
you know, this many shares in
the new round to keep your

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.631
ownership at approximately 3%,

00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:51.962
that is pro-rata rights at
their very most basic.

00:27:51.962 --> 00:27:55.920
So pro-rata rights are a very
common request for,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.070
from investors, and they are
not necessarily a bad thing.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.480
But you absolutely as

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.691
a founder need to know how
pro-rata rights work.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.960
Especially because, Kirstie
touched on this a little bit.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.060
The corollary to an investor
having pro-rata

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.130
rights to avoid dilution,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.800
is that the founders typically
suffer greater dilution.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.270
The final thing is information
rights.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.000
Investors almost always want

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.940
contractual information rights
about,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.760
to get certain information
about your company.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.650
Giving periodic information
and

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.180
status updates is not a bad
thing.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.230
In fact at YC we encourage
companies to

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.030
give monthly updates to their
investors, because

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.800
it&#39;s a great opportunity to
ask for help for

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.440
your, from your investors,
like introductions or

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.830
help with hiring, that kind of
thing.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.540
But you have to be really
careful about overreach.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.620
And the investor who&#39;s saying
they want like a month budget,

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.426
or a weekly update, that&#39;s not
okay.

00:28:50.426 --> 00:28:55.420
So the take-away here is that
just because

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.550
the type of financing and the
valuation has been negotiated,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.030
doesn&#39;t mean that everything
else is unimportant.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.080
You need to know everything
about your financing.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.270
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then moving on to
after you&#39;ve got that money.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.711
You know, you&#39;ve raised some
money the, the company bank

00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:16.030
accounts probably showing more
zeros than at,

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.080
than you&#39;ve ever seen in your
life.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.980
So, so then what?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.000
This is where

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.030
you actually start incurring
business expenses.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.740
And business expenses are the
cost of carrying out

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.810
your business.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.500
So things like paying
employees paying rent for

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.060
an office, hosting costs,
acquiring customers,

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.870
that kind of thing.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.900
And business expenses are
important,

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.650
because they get deducted on
the company&#39;s tax return

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.340
to offset any revenues that
are made to

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.810
lower the taxes that the
company pays.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.610
And on the flip side,

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.660
if it&#39;s a non-business expense
that the company incurs,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.180
then that is not deductible on
the tax return, so

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.870
that can increase the profits
that the company then have to

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.460
pay tax on.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.050
So, again, this is, this is a
separation issue.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.380
The company will have its own
bank accounts, and

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.260
that&#39;s where the company&#39;s
expenses should be paid

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:11.770
out of.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.620
again, you know, thinking
about this from a,

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.940
from a large company, if you
were working at Google,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.960
you would not use a Google
credit card to buy

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.150
a toothbrush and toothpaste.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:26.790
So the other thing to remember
is that, you know,

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.610
the investors gave you this
money.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.600
They trusted you with all
these huge amounts of, of,

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.500
of money, and they want you to

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.619
use that money to make the
company a success.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:41.500
It&#39;s not your money for you to
spend how you please.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.000
And believe me, we&#39;ve had some
horror stories of founders who

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.940
take that approach.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.960
We had, we had one founder
that we knew of who took

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.620
investor money and went off to
Vegas.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.979
And boy by his Facebook photos
did he have a good time.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.290
Needless to say he&#39;s no longer
with the company.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.440
But really this is, this is
stealing from the investors.

00:31:04.054 --> 00:31:07.571
You know, think about it the,
the concept of business

00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:10.782
expenses can get a little bit
blurry especially in

00:31:10.782 --> 00:31:13.766
the early days when you&#39;re
working outside,

00:31:13.766 --> 00:31:17.687
working in your apartment and
your working 24 hours a day.

00:31:17.687 --> 00:31:19.590
But the way to think about it
is,

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:23.046
if an investor asked me what
I&#39;d spent their money on, and

00:31:23.046 --> 00:31:25.795
I have to give a line by line
breakdown of that,

00:31:25.795 --> 00:31:28.686
would I be embarrassed about
telling any of the,

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:31.245
telling them what any of those
lines were?

00:31:31.245 --> 00:31:36.725
And if you were, it&#39;s probably
not a business expense.

00:31:36.725 --> 00:31:39.853
So, the other thing to bear in
mind is that, you know,

00:31:39.853 --> 00:31:43.117
you&#39;re busy running your
company at 90 miles an hour,

00:31:43.117 --> 00:31:44.760
just constant, constant.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.880
So you don&#39;t have to
necessarily think about

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.950
the bookkeeping and accounting
at that point, but it&#39;s really

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:54.710
crucial that you do keep the
receipts, so that when you do

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.500
engage a bookkeeper or a CPA
to prepare your tax returns.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.302
They can unpick all of this
and

00:32:00.302 --> 00:32:02.460
they can figure out what are
business expenses and

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.550
what aren&#39;t business expenses.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.840
But they&#39;re going to need your
help as a founder, because

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.110
they aren&#39;t going to know what
all these things are.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.180
So, there is some involvement
from you and the way to

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.760
make the involvement the least
amount possible,

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.180
is to keep those documents in
a safe place,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.780
so you can refer back to them.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.450
So, if nothing else that you
remember do not go to

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.540
Vegas on investors money and
spend that money wisely.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, so in this section
we&#39;re going to talk about just

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.940
doing business and, we&#39;re
going to hit a couple of

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.830
couple of topics in this
section.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.930
So the first one is founder
employment.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.710
Why are we talking about
founder employment?

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.970
Because, as we said a couple
times already,

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.300
the company is a separate
legal entity.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.300
It exists completely separate
and apart from U.S.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.260
founders, and so no matter how
prestigious we in

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.930
the valley think the title
founder is, you&#39;re

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.830
really just a company employee
and founders have to be paid.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:04.240
Working for free is against
the law,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.000
and founders should not let
their company take on

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.860
this liability.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.080
You wouldn&#39;t work for

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.940
free anywhere else, so why is
your startup an exception?

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.420
And companies have to pay
payroll taxes.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.690
We had a YC company that
completely blew

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:22.850
off their payroll taxes for
three years, it was a huge,

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.110
expensive disaster, and

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.480
in extreme cases, people can
actually go to jail for

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.320
that, fortunately not in this
case, but it&#39;s bad.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.380
So the moral of this story is
setup a payroll service.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.570
This is something that is
worth spending your money on.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.810
But, and I actually I think,
I&#39;m sure some of

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.600
the other lecturers have
touched on this points, and

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.240
actually Kirsty just mentioned
too.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.840
Don&#39;t go overboard on lavish
salaries, minimum wage this is

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.780
still a startup and you have
to run lean.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.020
So now I&#39;m going to mention
founder break ups,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.590
and first, well what is a
founder break up?

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.410
In this context I&#39;m talking
about one found,

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.080
founder on the team being
asked to leave the company.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.130
Which, because I&#39;ve just said
founders are employees,

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.830
that means your cofounders are
firing you.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.410
So why are we talking about
breakups in the context of

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:15.180
founder compensation, and it&#39;s
because, at YC we have seen

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.560
a ton of founder breakups and
we know that the breakups get

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.180
extra ugly when the founders
haven&#39;t paid themselves.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:23.350
Why, how does it get ugly?

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.220
Unpaid wages become leverage
for

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.940
the fired founder to get
something he or she wants from

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.800
the company, and typically
that is vesting acceleration.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.160
So the fired founder says,
hey,

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.540
my lawyer says you broke the
law by not paying me.

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:42.188
But if you pay me, and

00:34:42.188 --> 00:34:45.638
you give me some shares that
I&#39;m not actually entitled to,

00:34:45.638 --> 00:34:49.088
I&#39;ll sign a release and make
all this ugliness go away, and

00:34:49.088 --> 00:34:51.365
if you&#39;re the remaining
cofounders,

00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:54.280
you&#39;re probably like, sounds
like a good deal.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.548
And so now you have a
disgruntled person who

00:34:56.548 --> 00:34:59.383
owns a piece of your company
and even worse in a sense,

00:34:59.383 --> 00:35:01.840
the remaining founders are
kind of working for

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.360
that ex-founder, right?

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.340
Because they&#39;re building all
the value in the company and

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.100
the ex-founder who got fired
is just sitting there with

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.090
their shares going, that&#39;s
right, make it valuable.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.770
So, what&#39;s the takeaway here?

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.410
Avoid problems by paying
yourself, paying your

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.660
payroll taxes, and thinking up
of your co-founder&#39;s wages

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.860
like a marital prenup.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.500
&gt;&gt; And as well as the
founders,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.810
you are going to need to hire
employees.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.060
And again, a lot&#39;s been spoken
in previous,

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.500
in previous classes here about
how to find those people,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.670
what makes a good fit,

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.280
how to make them really
productive employees.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.740
But when you actually find
somebody, how,

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.890
how do you hire them?

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.969
You know, what&#39;s, what&#39;s
involved?

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.880
And employment is governed by
a huge raft of laws, and

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.640
therefore it&#39;s important to
get this right.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.850
It&#39;s again the kind of
nitty-gritty stuff that as

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.440
long as you know the basics
you can probably keep yourself

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.150
out of most situations, but as
soon as things get complicated

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:00.750
you need to get yourself
involved with a specialist.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.270
So the first thing you need to
do is figure out if

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.180
the employee or

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.230
if the person is really an
employee or a contractor, and

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.800
there are subtle differences
to this classification.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.070
And this is important to get
right because the IRS

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:19.818
takes a big interest in this
and if they think you&#39;ve got

00:36:19.818 --> 00:36:23.110
it wrong they will come after
you and with fines.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.512
Both an employee and a
contractor will sign documents

00:36:26.512 --> 00:36:29.990
that assign any IP that they
create to the company, and

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.970
that&#39;s obviously really
important.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:36.000
But the, the form of the
document is very different for

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.220
each, each type of person and

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.820
the method of payment&#39;s very
different.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.620
So generally, a contractor
will be able to set their own

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.910
work hours, they&#39;ll be able to
set their own location.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.170
They will be given a project
where there is an end result,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.000
but how they actually get to
that and

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.010
the means they use will, will
not be set.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.960
They&#39;ll be using their own
equipment, and

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.890
they&#39;ll not really have any
say in the day to day running

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:05.770
of the company or their
strategy going forward.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:09.186
And a contractor will sign a
consulting agreement, and

00:37:09.186 --> 00:37:10.931
when the company pays them,

00:37:10.931 --> 00:37:14.710
the company doesn&#39;t withhold
any taxes on their behalf, and

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.852
that&#39;s on the responsibility
of the individual.

00:37:17.852 --> 00:37:20.721
But at the end of the year,
the company will

00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:24.789
provide what&#39;s called a form
1099 to the individual and

00:37:24.789 --> 00:37:27.578
also a copy to the IRS which
they&#39;ll use to

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:30.150
prepare their personal tax
returns.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:33.746
The opposite side of this is,

00:37:33.746 --> 00:37:36.560
is an employee, and an
employee will

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:40.520
also sign some form of IP
assignment agreement.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.550
But when the company pays
them,

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.510
the company will withhold tax,
taxes from their salary, and

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.050
then the company is
responsible for

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.900
paying those taxes over to the
relevant State and

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.090
Federal authorities.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.570
And at the end of the year the
employee receives what,

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.020
a W-2 form, which will then
get used to prepare their

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.149
personal tax returns.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.750
So, as Carolina said, the
founders need to be paid so

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.160
do employees, it isn&#39;t enough
to just say well I&#39;m

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.160
paying them in stock so that
can be,

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.810
that can be their, their
compensation,

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.730
and they need to be paid at
least minimum wage.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.182
So, in San Francisco which
actually has a slightly

00:38:20.182 --> 00:38:23.312
higher minimum wage than, than
California as

00:38:23.312 --> 00:38:27.081
a whole that works out to
about $2000 a month, so,

00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:31.037
you know, it&#39;s not a huge
amount, but it, it can add up.

00:38:31.037 --> 00:38:34.196
There&#39;s also another couple of
things that you need to be,

00:38:34.196 --> 00:38:37.750
you need to make sure that you
have, if you have employees.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.170
So, the first thing is that
you&#39;re required to

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.030
have workers&#39; compensation
insurance, and

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.300
especially if you&#39;re in New
York

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.850
where the New York authorities
that look after this will send

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.400
really threatening letters
saying you owe $50,000 in

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.550
fine because your one employee
that&#39;s being paid minimum wage

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.930
is not paid the $20 a month
workers compensation fees.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:03.180
So it is really important that
you do, you do set that up,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.150
and the other thing that&#39;s
very important is that you

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.630
do need to see proof that the
employee is authorized to work

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:15.670
in the U.S. you know, founders
are not payroll experts and

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.610
nobody expects you to be one
either.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.480
This is all just about the
basics, but

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.890
what that does mean is that
you absolutely must use

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:26.640
a payroll service provider who
will,

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.550
who will be able to look out
after this for you,.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.260
And services like Zen Payroll
are again set up, they&#39;re

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:35.190
focused on start ups and they
help you get this set up in

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.160
the easiest way possible, so
that again you can go back and

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.730
concentrate on, on what you do
best.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.940
And in the example that
Caroline gave just a few

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.790
minutes ago, if that company
had actually set themselves up

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.790
with a payroll service
provider,

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.500
all of that heartache would
have gone away because it

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.580
would all of just been looked
after for them.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.330
They were trying to save money
by not doing it and

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.110
look where it got them.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.390
So that&#39;s, that&#39;s really the
key thing,

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.560
use, use a payroll service
provider and

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.140
make sure that you understand
the basics of employment.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.936
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re running short on
time.

00:40:07.936 --> 00:40:09.234
Yeah okay, so

00:40:09.234 --> 00:40:12.730
I can breeze really fast
firing employees slide and

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.560
then should, or should we cut
it off now for questions?

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.420
What?

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.550
&gt;&gt; Why don&#39;t we do firings
real fast?

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.620
Okay.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:23.570
Okay, so somebody at YC once
said you&#39;re not

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.410
a real founder until you&#39;ve
had to fire somebody.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.210
Why is that?

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.510
Because firing people is
really hard.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.400
It&#39;s hard for a lot of reasons
including because

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.120
founders tend to hire their
friends.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.710
They tend to hire former
coworkers, or

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.890
they just get really close to
their

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.120
employees because working in a
startup is really intense.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.420
But in every company there is
going to

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.620
be an employee who doesn&#39;t
work out.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.340
And firing a founder, sorry,
firing this employee

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.380
makes a founder a real
professional because he or

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.540
she has to do what is right
for

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:54.300
the company instead is what is
easy.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.570
So I have some best practices
for

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:01.710
how to fire someone number
one, fire quickly.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.730
Don&#39;t let a bad employee
linger.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:06.190
It&#39;s so easy to put off the
difficult conversation but

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.600
there is only downside to
procrastination.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.300
If a toxic employee stays
around too

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.260
long, good employees may quit,
and if the employee&#39;s actually

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.500
screwing up the job, you may
lose business or users.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.970
Number two, communicate
effectively.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.900
Don&#39;t rationalize, don&#39;t make
excuses,

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.480
don&#39;t equivocate about why
you&#39;re firing the employee,

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.050
make clear, direct statements,
don&#39;t apologize.

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.400
Example, we&#39;re letting you go.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.050
Not, I&#39;m so sorry,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.120
sales didn&#39;t take off this
quarter, blah, blah, blah.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.060
Fire the employee face to face
and

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.200
ideally with a third party
present.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.480
Number three, pay all wages
and

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.430
accrued vacation immediately.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:46.940
This is a legal requirement.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.350
We don&#39;t debate or negotiate
this.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.260
Number four, cut off access to
digital systems.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.032
Once an employee is out the
door, cut off physical and

00:41:56.032 --> 00:41:56.963
digital access.

00:41:56.963 --> 00:41:58.276
Control information on,

00:41:58.276 --> 00:42:00.610
in the cloud, change
passwords, et cetera.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.048
We, we had a situation at YC
where one founder.

00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:06.045
Had access to the company&#39;s
GitHub account and held

00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:09.530
the password hostage when his
cofounders tried to fire him.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.280
And number five,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.410
if the terminated has any
investitures,

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.968
the company should repurchase
them right away.

00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:20.710
So, the take-away here is that
is as surprising as this

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:21.690
may sound.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.820
One of hallmarks of a really
effective start-up founder is

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.690
how well he or she handles
employee terminations.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.920
okay.
So

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.160
then, we had this section that
we called legitimacy,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.830
which actually going to, goes
into a little bit more about,.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.430
You know, how to be, how to be
a real company.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.030
How to be sort of a grown up
company.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.436
And we can totally jettison-

00:42:41.436 --> 00:42:42.597
&gt;&gt; Is this the last slide?

00:42:45.533 --> 00:42:46.132
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No.

00:42:46.132 --> 00:42:47.156
&gt;&gt; We have our take-aways-

00:42:47.156 --> 00:42:48.913
&gt;&gt; Take away the last slide.

00:42:48.913 --> 00:42:49.850
&gt;&gt; Take-aways.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:50.711
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So, Chris,

00:42:50.711 --> 00:42:51.880
you want to read the
take-aways?

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.780
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, we&#39;ve,

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.570
we&#39;ve pretty much covered all
of these anyway.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.530
But, you know, the basic,

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.330
the basic tenet to all of this
is, keep it simple.

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.750
Do all the standard stuff.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:03.970
And keep it organized to

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.150
make sure you know what you&#39;re
doing.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.470
Equity ownership is really
important.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.520
So make sure that you&#39;re
thinking about the future

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.890
rather the three months of the
history of the company.

00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:15.550
A stock doesn&#39;t buy itself, so

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.800
again, make sure you do the
paperwork for that.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.460
Make sure that you actually
know about

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.510
the financing documents that
you&#39;re signing up to.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.850
It&#39;s not enough to just say,
yeah, I&#39;ll take your 100k.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.860
Make sure you actually know
those rights.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.850
And you need to get paid.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.930
You and the employees need to
be paid.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.260
And then, everybody needs to
assign IP to the company.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.538
Because if the company does
not own this IP,

00:43:39.538 --> 00:43:41.270
there is no value in the
company.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.780
If an employee must be fired,
then as Carolyn,

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.780
as Carolyn was saying, do it
quickly and professionally.

00:43:51.926 --> 00:43:53.047
The couple of things,

00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:55.960
that we didn&#39;t mention, was
knowing your key metrics.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.360
At any time, you should know
the cash position,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.550
you should know your burn
rate,

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.884
you should know when that cash
is going to run out.

00:44:03.884 --> 00:44:06.748
So that you can talk to your
investors, about that, and,

00:44:06.748 --> 00:44:07.280
you know.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.140
A lot of running a company is
following the rules and

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.260
taking it seriously.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.190
It&#39;s not all the glamorous
bits that we see in

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.380
all the movies and

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.890
TV shows, so you do have to
take that seriously.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.064
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:22.064 --> 00:44:25.032
So, it was shorter when we did
it the first time.

00:44:25.032 --> 00:44:26.696
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s right.

00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:28.018
&gt;&gt; Sorry about that!

00:44:28.018 --> 00:44:28.568
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:44:28.568 --> 00:44:29.074
&gt;&gt; If you could get like,

00:44:29.074 --> 00:44:29.638
two questions in there?

00:44:29.638 --> 00:44:31.000
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.868
How do you advise

00:44:31.868 --> 00:44:33.485
searching for an accountant?

00:44:33.485 --> 00:44:35.730
And when in the process do you
need them?

00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:36.910
&gt;&gt; So there&#39;s two.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.130
So, the question was how do
you advise searching for

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:40.140
a, an accountant?

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.053
And when do you.

00:44:42.053 --> 00:44:44.050
When, at what point do you do
this?

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.420
So, there&#39;s two different
things.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.690
There&#39;s a bookkeeper and
there&#39;s a CPA, an accountant.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.660
And generally, bookkeepers
will be the ones who

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.110
can categorize all your
expenses.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.500
And CPAs are the ones that
will prepare you tax returns.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.550
In the very, very early days,
it&#39;s probably fine for

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:03.970
the founders to just be able
to see the bank statements and

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.720
to be able to see those
expenses coming out.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.120
But tax returns have to be
prepared annually.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.360
And so, at some point in that
first year of the company&#39;s

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.610
life, some service is going to
need to be.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:17.570
Engaged to do that,

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:21.050
because it&#39;s just not worth
the founder&#39;s time to do it.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.340
There are services available,

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.690
like inDinero, which kind of
try to, to make things as

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.000
effortless as possible from
the founder&#39;s point of view.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.860
So that kind of thing is quite
useful, but

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.240
you do need to get a CPA at
some point.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:35.762
Because you need to

00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:37.570
file your annual tax returns
for the company.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:40.780
&gt;&gt; And how do you find one?

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.110
&gt;&gt; Finding one is kind of
tough.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:46.620
Probably the best thing is
recommendations from people.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.680
With, with any kind of
specialist, a CPA or an

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.430
account a lawyer, or anything
like that, it&#39;s always best to

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.090
use people who are used to
dealing with startups.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:58.350
Again, not your, sort of, you
know, your aunt who lives in

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.620
Minnesota and doesn&#39;t actually
know how startups work.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:04.283
So, probably recommendations
are the best way.

00:46:06.948 --> 00:46:09.820
Sure.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.090
&gt;&gt; Considering what&#39;s in a
budget for

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:12.540
you know incorporating the
lawyer for

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.880
getting legal advice for

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.856
my first seed round and then
for hiring the first employee.

00:46:16.856 --> 00:46:21.100
Money for that
&gt;&gt; So,

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.910
in terms of incorporation,
don&#39;t spend a dime on that.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:24.610
You can do that online.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.840
&gt;&gt; Well, I, actually, I&#39;m
sorry.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.070
It does cost a little bit.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.220
&gt;&gt; It just costs, yes.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.940
&gt;&gt; Incorporating online using
a, a, a service like Clerky,

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.090
which Kirsti mentioned, is
inexpensive,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:36.830
like in the hundreds, not in
the thousands.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:38.120
So you don&#39;t need a lawyer for
that part.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.380
When you actually need to hire
a lawyer is,

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.280
it kind of depends on what
business you are starting, and

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.680
how complicated it is in terms
of, you know,

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.850
do you have a lot of privacy
policies, do you, is

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.760
HIPA involved, I mean you can
imagine, there&#39;s like a ton.

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.310
And so, and also when then you

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.150
mention when you&#39;re raising
your seed around.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.070
Well, how much money are you
raising and

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.540
who are the investors and

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.600
what kind of terms are in the
term sheet?

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.840
Sometimes that dictates
whether or

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.480
not you need to get legal
council.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:08.745
&gt;&gt; And again, a service like
can help if you&#39;re just

00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:11.970
using very standard documents
for the fundraising.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:15.420
There are very basic, vanilla
fundraising documents so,

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.470
you can use those.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.795
And again, they, they cost you
know, less,

00:47:18.795 --> 00:47:21.709
less than $100, I think, which
can save you some legal fees.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.610
One more question.

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.950
&gt;&gt; Do you want to take?

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:30.280
Should we go back over this
side?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.360
I&#39;m going to ignore good luck.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.030
Let&#39;s go over here.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.150
&gt;&gt; Do you guys have any advice
or

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:36.250
comment on the complexity that
comes with working with

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.260
cryptocurrencies or
cryptoequities in particular?

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.040
Like your fundraising, since
that&#39;s becoming more and

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.160
more popular.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:43.930
Oh, wow.
That&#39;s a tough

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.680
question to end with.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.470
yes.
There are,

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:47.630
there are some issues.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.550
Often banks will struggle to
deal with,

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.430
with companies that are
working cryptocurrencies.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.530
Because they haven&#39;t quite
figured out how to,

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.520
to deal with it, and, and that
sort of thing yet.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.870
generally, a lot of it,

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.110
it, it&#39;s, it&#39;s very
product-specific.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:02.510
It, it&#39;s not something that
kind of

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:09.709
has real general advice
unfortunately.

00:48:09.709 --> 00:48:10.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.990
Thank you very much.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.490
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re welcome.

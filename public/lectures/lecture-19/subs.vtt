WEBVTT

00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.953
Okay, great.

00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:05.895
So okay, great, thanks for
having me.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.024
So, my name&#39;s Tyler I&#39;m the
CEO of Clever and

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.760
what I want to talk today is
about sales.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.030
And I&#39;ve a little bit of
insight into this I graduated

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.970
college, I actually studied
math and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.890
statistics, probably like some
of you here in this room.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.590
And thought I was destined for
this world of, finance.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.060
I was about to go start at a
hedge fund.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.350
And at the last second, a
friend of mine roped me in to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.370
join his startup, and asked me
to do sales there, which was

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.190
something that I knew nothing
about, and so, had to

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.730
figure out on the fly, and
spent a couple of years there,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.710
figuring out sales for this
very early stage company.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.010
And then, when it came to
start Clever, you know,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.950
we started Clever, and I did
it with two co-founders who

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.450
are very technical, and one
very product-oriented, and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.410
we wanted to build this
product for schools, and I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.730
thought that experience would
have no relevancy whatsoever.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.335
But it turns out that some of
the things that I picked up at

00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:04.860
the, this previous job, where
it was figuring out sales,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
have been huge parts of what&#39;s
made Clever grow so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.600
quickly today.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.330
Quick background on Clever, we
build software for schools.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.090
We are an app platform used by
developers and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.610
it&#39;s used today by about one
in five schools in America.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.160
And we started it about two
years ago.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520
And so sales have been a be,
key piece of that, and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.130
I want to use this time to
just share some of

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.630
the things that have worked
for me along the way.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.050
Of course, there&#39;s a million
ways to do this,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.760
so you&#39;ll find what works for
you.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.520
So first I want to start about
how most,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.160
how I used to perceive sales.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.760
And a lot of people see sales
as having this, you know,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.930
a lot of mystique around it.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.250
You know, it&#39;s people who are
you know,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.670
really articulate and
impossibly charming.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.850
And they have these, you know,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.310
killer closing lines that they
use.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.330
And I think this is how I saw
sales, and I think this is

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.680
how a lot of founders I talked
to see sales, because they say

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.010
things to me like, you know,
we&#39;re just going to work on

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.530
the product and build a great
product, and then when it&#39;s

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.280
finally finished we&#39;re
going to hire the salespeople.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.010
And what I&#39;ve learned is that
hire the salespeople,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.800
as a founder, the reality is
that&#39;s you.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.310
And so you know, Paul Graham
likes to talk about how

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.480
there&#39;s two things you should
be doing at any point in

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.650
time when you&#39;re starting your
company.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.280
You&#39;re either talking to your
users or

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.120
you&#39;re building your product.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.280
And that talking to your users
part, that&#39;s selling.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.470
And so.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.940
You know, this is intimidating
to some people because

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.100
they&#39;re like, I&#39;ve never done
sales, and I don&#39;t,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.980
wouldn&#39;t even know where to
begin.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.550
But it turns out that as a
founder,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.940
you have some unique
advantages that make it,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.150
possible for you to be really,
really good at sales.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.670
And one of those is your
passion for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.040
the product, and what you&#39;re
building.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.650
And the second is your
industry knowledge of what

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.660
your, of the industry and the
problem that you&#39;re solving.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.880
And those two things actually
totally trump sales experience

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.500
from what I&#39;ve seen.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.210
So, this is actually my
cofounder, doing sales.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.280
This is what sales,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.380
looks like in the very early
stage of a startup.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.280
It&#39;s not Don Draper.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.550
It&#39;s a lot of calls like
these.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.450
But this is something that
even as

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.440
a founder who&#39;s never done it
before, it&#39;s very easy to do,

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.556
but you have to commit
yourself.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:14.709
And what we did at Clever was
we dedicated one founder,

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.536
which was me, to peel off and
say,

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:19.814
okay, Tyler you&#39;re going to go
figure this out and and work

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:23.116
on this full time because it&#39;s
so important to our business.

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:28.344
So, couple things that I&#39;ve
picked up about sales along

00:03:28.344 --> 00:03:30.160
the way and in, in trying to
figure this out.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.140
You know, the first thing that
everybody knows about sales is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.230
they say, okay, it&#39;s a funnel.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.830
And you have these different
stages of funnels and you, of,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.320
of the funnel and you move
your customers through it.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.570
Pretty common categories.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.550
There&#39;s this prospecting
category where

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.950
you&#39;re trying to figure out
who&#39;s even interested.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.900
Then you&#39;re having a lot of
conversations,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.800
which is the second level of
the funnel.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.540
Then you&#39;re finding out who&#39;s
really serious and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.230
you want to close them and
sign the deal.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.830
And then of course,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.300
you&#39;re in the promised land
of, of revenue.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.120
And what I thought would be
interesting would be to talk

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.110
about each of the stage, a
couple strategies that

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.640
we&#39;ve used at Clever that
have, worked really well.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.380
So that these aren&#39;t abstract
things but

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.308
things that, you know, you can
hopefully use at your startup.

00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:14.321
So, prospecting.

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.030
So, prospecting is the process
of

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.290
figuring out who will even
take your call.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.430
And you know, one of the
things that I

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.860
realized early on, so there&#39;s
this guy Everett Rogers who,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.270
who&#39;s created this technology
life cycle adoption curve.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.180
And he describes it as bell
curve where you&#39;ve got you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.280
know, your innovators and who
will try new things, and

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.490
you&#39;ve got your early
adopters,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.920
your mid-stage adopters, your
late adopters, your laggards.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.850
And one of the things that was
really helpful for

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.018
me in understanding sales in
an early startup is he&#39;s

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:49.510
quantified the tail of this
bell curve and this part over

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.670
here, the innovators, those
are your potential customers.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.090
And it might seem discouraging
that only 2.5% of companies

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.340
are your potential customers
that would even consider

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.090
buying from a startup that has
no users and no revenue.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.090
But actually, I found just the
opposite.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.440
I found it to be extremely
helpful to have this frame of

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.680
mind, because you realize,
when only 2.5% of companies

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.130
will even take your call or
consider using your product,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.220
you realize what a numbers
game this becomes.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.550
So if you want to reach that
2.5% and

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.170
you want to get some early
sales, you, you&#39;ve,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.490
if you&#39;re starting to do math,
you&#39;re hopefully starting to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.710
realize you have to do a lot
of calling.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.579
You have to do, talk to a lot
of people.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.270
So early on in the early days
at Clever, this was my job.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.080
You know, in the,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.060
in the 2 months the first two
months of YC,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.070
I reached out to over 400
companies trying to get them

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.390
to take a call and and talk to
us about what we&#39;re building.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.630
There&#39;s, there&#39;s three ways
that I

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.960
have found most successful in,
in prospecting and

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.440
getting these people, one is
your personal network.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.120
That&#39;s obvious.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.930
I&#39;m not going to spend any
time there.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.980
Another one is conferences,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.100
which is surprising to a lot
of people, and then the one

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.730
that people are most familiar
with is cold email.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.160
And when I say conferences,
this is what people think.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.010
They think I&#39;m talking about
CES or, you know,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.420
E3 or something.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.900
And actually, the kind of

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.960
conferences where sales happen
look more like this.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.590
And we&#39;ve got, we would in the
early days would go to a lot

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.980
of these because you&#39;ve got to
where your users are.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.450
And if they&#39;re, if you&#39;re
selling to CIOs and there

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.420
happens to be a gathering of
them at a hotel in Milwaukee,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.750
guess what, that&#39;s probably
where you should be.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.020
So we go to conferences like
these.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.445
We get the attendee lists in
advance.

00:06:31.445 --> 00:06:34.440
We email every single person
in advance, and, and try and

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.210
set up meetings so that when
we get there,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.720
every single minute of that
trip was, was well spent.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.900
And this was huge in Clever&#39;s
early days.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.120
These, this was where we met
all of our earliest customers.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.500
The second thing I mentioned
is cold email.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.670
A lot of people don&#39;t know how
to write cold emails.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.420
It&#39;s actually really easy, and
the key is not to write a lot.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.410
Should be really concise.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.560
This is an email template that
I used early on and

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.740
you&#39;re welcome to copy it, but
it&#39;s really short.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.590
Here&#39;s who I am, here&#39;s what
I&#39;m building, and

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.800
I&#39;d love to talk to you about
this.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.949
Could we find time tomorrow?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.830
It&#39;s really easy and, and you
can customize this and

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.400
find out for

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.240
every business you want to
sell to who&#39;s the right person

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.750
to send it to and you can send
out quite a few of these.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.810
So all right, that&#39;s
prospecting.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.930
And the reason this is so
important is because you&#39;ve

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.960
gotta build that first layer
of the funnel.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.830
Then you get them to take your
call.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.130
And this is another place
where a lot of

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.680
founders I think just have a
lot of

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.390
questions about what to
actually do.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.900
And the biggest thing to take
away,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.060
in fact if you only take away
one thing from this

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.220
presentation today, the number
one thing you should remember

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.960
is when you get them on the
phone, remember to shut up.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.810
And that&#39;s really surprising
to people.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.500
So many founders, when I help
them with

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.390
their first sales pitch, they
finally get somebody on

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.470
the phone who wants to talk to
them about their product.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.310
And they&#39;re so proud of this
thing they&#39;ve been

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.570
building for the last three
months that all they want to

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.270
do is get on the phone and
talk about every feature and

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.140
talk about all the different
things they can do and

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.570
talk about why it&#39;s the
greatest thing in the world.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.130
And I have that temptation
too.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.850
It&#39;s just part of being really
proud of something.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.920
But it turns out that if you
watch the best salespeople,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.620
like the best salespeople in
the world, the top 1%.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.990
And you have a chance to
listen in on a call with some

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.030
of those people, like I have,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.870
the most surprising thing is
how little talking they do.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.020
In fact, I&#39;ve seen calls where
the,

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.730
where the salesperson told me
their goal was to

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.550
only spend 30% of the call
talking, and

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.440
have 70% of the call the other
person.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.660
And they would ask a lot of
questions.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.670
They&#39;d say things like,

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.780
why did you even agree to take
my call today?

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.070
This problem that we&#39;re
talking about solving for you,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.059
how do you solve it today?

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.430
You know, what would your
ideal solution look like?

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.190
And they&#39;re not, they&#39;re not
doing the talking.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.880
They&#39;re finding, they&#39;re doing
everything they can to find

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.660
out what this person needs,
and hopefully understand their

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.280
problem even better than they
do.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.870
That&#39;s what really great sales
is and in fact this is

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.120
something I, I, I, I drill
into everybody at Clever.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.730
It&#39;s a really important part
of sales and

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.950
there&#39;s actually now if any of
you use Uber Conference,

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.120
they have this amazing feature
where when you hang up

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.560
a call it sends you an email
automatically and tells you

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.270
how much you talked versus how
much the other person talked.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.810
And looking at one of those
emails you know,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.660
if someone doing sales at
Clever, I get one of those

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.080
emails, I can tell immediately
how likely the sale is

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.940
based on how much talking we
were doing.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.380
So, you got all these people,
now you got on the phone,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.440
do a lot of listening, really
understand their problem.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.550
And then the other part of
this stage that surprises

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.460
a lot of people is follow up.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.420
So here&#39;s a lot of different
steps that you

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.000
can imagine going through.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.250
You know, emailing somebody,
not getting a response, and

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.430
emailing them back.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.570
Calling them, leaving a voice
mail, having a pricing call.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.360
You know, there&#39;s probably
like you know,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.920
60 things up here on this
slide that could be steps for

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.640
closing a deal.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.570
These actually aren&#39;t just
random things,

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.770
this is one deal that,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.730
this was the second deal
Clever ever signed.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.460
These are all the different
steps that we had to in

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.630
order to get this done.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.650
And you can see there&#39;s a lot
of really embarrassing things

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.520
up there like I emailed
somebody and they didn&#39;t

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.480
respond and I emailed them
again and they didn&#39;t respond.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.650
And then I emailed them again
and

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.610
this is from somebody who
wanted to buy our product.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.255
Isn&#39;t that crazy?

00:10:20.255 --> 00:10:21.658
Ana that surprises a lot of
people.

00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:23.675
I see so many founders today
have a great call with

00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:25.889
someone, they send an email,
they dont hear back and

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.017
they say, oh that person might
not be interested.

00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:29.378
well, guess what,

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.670
this is what it looks like in
the best case and.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.782
And so you really have to have
kind of,

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:38.148
this unhuman, unreasonable
willingness to follow up, and

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:39.600
drive things to closure.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.030
Now, qualify with that with
one thing.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.620
Which is to say, when you&#39;re
starting a company,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.320
your time is extremely
valuable.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.430
because it&#39;s your only
resource.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.240
And, and you couldn&#39;t possibly
do this for

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.480
every single person who might
buy your product.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.030
So your goal should be to get
people to a yes or

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.930
a no, as quickly as you can.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.250
Where you die is if you have a
thousand maybes.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.010
And sometimes I talk to
founders who say oh, yeah,

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.510
I have this great pipeline of
you know, a hundred people who

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.950
are, who have expressed
interest in our product.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.380
And the maybes are what kill
you.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.440
If you can get to a yes or

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.520
a no, in some ways a no is, is
even better than a maybe.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.560
Because it allows you to move
on and

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.670
focus on somebody who might be
a yes.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.030
So, have this super-human
level of,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.150
of follow up and ambition.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.820
But make sure you&#39;re focusing
it on the right pieces.

00:11:28.491 --> 00:11:29.430
All right.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.240
So you&#39;ve talked to someone,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.640
you&#39;ve talked to a ton of
people.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.960
You&#39;ve had all these phone
calls.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.243
You&#39;ve followed up with them
ridiculously.

00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:36.119
To the point where they,

00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:37.622
they just know you&#39;re not
going away, and

00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:38.890
they&#39;ve gotta sign an
agreement.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.020
This final step is something
that,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.790
if you haven&#39;t done before, it
might seem opaque, but

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.650
it&#39;s actually really simple.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.580
It&#39;s called redlining.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.370
So you&#39;ll send over an
agreement.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.020
Their lawyers will mark it up.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.451
Your Lawyers will mark it up
and

00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:52.078
you kind of go back and forth.

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:55.345
If you&#39;re part of YC, this is
really easy because YC

00:11:55.345 --> 00:11:59.030
has standard template
agreements that they give you.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.920
So you don&#39;t have to find
these and

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.130
you can just you know, use
those.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.740
But they&#39;ve never been
available, you know,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.050
if you weren&#39;t part of YC you
kind of had to

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.050
figure this out on your own.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.080
One of the things that I&#39;m
really excited about is,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.680
as part of this presentation,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.170
YC has agreed to open source
their deal documents.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.440
So these documents that YC
founders used to

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.360
get are now going to be
available to everybody.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.790
So this should never,
hopefully,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.470
never be a barrier to anyone
who wants to do sales for

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.030
their start up.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:26.560
You&#39;ve got some great
documents.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.670
And then the other thing I&#39;ll
say about this,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.870
a place I see so many smart,
smart people go wrong,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.320
is you gotta remember what
your goal is.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.670
Your goal is to sign some
deals, and

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.760
get some reference customers,
and

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.470
get some validation and get
some revenue.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.540
That, if you don&#39;t do that,

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.780
your start up is, is, you
know, toast.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.770
So in light of that, it&#39;s
really surprising how many

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.230
smart people will want to do
ten rounds of document review.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.710
Quibbling over the most minor
points because of pride,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.930
because of intelligence,
whatever.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.860
You know, make sure the
agreement is the way

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.840
you want it, but then sign it
and move on.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.880
I&#39;ve seen founders spend
months quibbling over

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.480
some indemnification clauses.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.210
And their business would have
been way better off if they&#39;d

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.630
you know, just signed the deal
and moved onto the next one.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.200
So, that&#39;s one closing trap
you can fall into.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.770
I&#39;ve two more.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.050
One other closing trap that I
see founders struggle with

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.160
a lot, is they&#39;re talking to a
company who says,

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.790
I will use your product, but I
just need one more feature.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.380
You know?
Or

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.850
they say you know, I&#39;d love to
use your product but

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.823
it doesn&#39;t have this one
feature so

00:13:32.823 --> 00:13:34.727
we&#39;re just not ready.

00:13:34.727 --> 00:13:38.060
And to most people, especially
if you&#39;re ambitious,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.680
when somebody says that to you
what you want to hear is, oh,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.960
well I can build that feature.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.740
Great.
You know,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.420
I&#39;ll build that feature and

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.330
then they&#39;re going to use my
product.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.420
But the problem is, it almost
never works that way.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.470
In fact, somebody telling you
that they would use your,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.530
they want to use your product
but

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.860
it&#39;s just missing this one
feature.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.050
I would almost map that to a
pass in your mind.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.850
Because nine times out of

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.080
ten if you actually build that
feature.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.840
You go back to them and

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.110
then there&#39;d be one more
feature, or there&#39;d be

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.000
some other reason that they&#39;re
not using the product.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.910
So, if somebody says to you
hey, I want to, but, you know,

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.160
there&#39;s this one thing that&#39;s
preventing us

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.190
from using your product.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.300
I would do one of two things.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.040
One say, well that&#39;s great.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.150
Let&#39;s sign an agreement.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.150
And we&#39;ll put in

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.840
the agreement that we&#39;re
going to build this feature.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.300
In which case, you know,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.280
you know that if you build it
you&#39;re off to the races.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.670
Or more commonly,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.516
what we did at Clever was we
would say, that&#39;s great.

00:14:26.516 --> 00:14:27.680
We&#39;re going to wait to see if

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.120
we hear that demand from more
customers.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.090
And then once you have a lot
of customers requesting it,

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.602
then you should build it
regardless.

00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:35.190
And then, and then you&#39;re not,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.830
you don&#39;t have to worry about
doing something that&#39;s

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.610
customer one-off, which is
what you really want to avoid.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.880
So, don&#39;t fall into this trap,
it happens all the time.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.480
And the other trap I would
highly,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.140
highly recommend you try to
avoid is the free trial trap.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.420
Because this hap, happens all
the time.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.420
People, you know, they go down
this path with a,

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.860
with a customer, it seems
really exciting.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.880
And then the customer says,
oh,

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.010
well can I get a free trial?

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.120
And you can&#39;t blame them.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.310
That&#39;s a totally reasonable
thing to ask for.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.380
But the problem is,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.490
when you&#39;re starting a start
up you need revenue,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:10.040
you need validation, you need
users, you need commitment.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.970
And free trials get you none
of those things.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.430
So you go, you do all this
work, and

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:15.970
if you end up with a free
trial,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.500
unfortunately, you haven&#39;t
made as much progress as you.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.255
It&#39;s actually terrible.

00:15:19.255 --> 00:15:21.490
You, you think you&#39;ve made
progress.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.900
But really, at the end of the
free trial,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.880
you&#39;re going to have to sell
them all over again.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.970
So the way I handle this that
has worked really well,

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.472
is when somebody says, can I
get a free trial?

00:15:29.472 --> 00:15:33.270
You say, well we don&#39;t, we
don&#39;t do free trials.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.670
But what we can do is we&#39;re
going to,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.600
we do annual agreements here.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.130
And what we&#39;ll do is for the
first 30 or 60 days, if for

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.740
any reason you&#39;re not happy,
you can opt out.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.300
And that&#39;s a way to get you
the things that you need,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.240
while giving them the comfort
that they might need to take

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.840
a chance on a start up.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.570
So that minor change is
actually makes a night and

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.480
day difference when you&#39;re,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.930
when you&#39;re thinking about
these things.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.930
All right.
So, you&#39;ve prospected.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.650
You&#39;ve had a lot of
conversations.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.630
Now you&#39;ve closed people.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.890
You&#39;ve gone through the
redline process.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.330
You worked out the free
trials.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.310
And you&#39;re on your way,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.480
hopefully, to your first
sales.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.310
Now early on, you could think
of

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.040
sales as just like any other
thing of a start up.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.550
Your goal is to, you don&#39;t
have to do things that scale.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.040
In fact you can purposely do
unscalable things to try and

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.590
get early customers.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.540
That&#39;s, that&#39;s the fun of it.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.250
But the other thing that I
think is really important to

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.820
keep in mind is, once you&#39;ve
done this enough.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.760
What you should start thinking
about is,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.480
well what aspects of this are
repeatable?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.710
And, and what aspects of this,
you know,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.760
are we going to scale further?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.540
And there&#39;s this,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.000
Cristoph Janz has this really
great blog post online about

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.087
the five ways to build a $100
million company.

00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:43.781
And he talks about, he can
have a thousand customers buy

00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:45.798
a product that costs $100,000.

00:16:45.798 --> 00:16:47.484
Or he can have 10,000
customers buy

00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:49.080
a product that costs $10,000.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.819
Or he can have 100,000
customers buy

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:52.278
a product that costs $1,000.

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.094
And even though you don&#39;t need
to know on day one,

00:16:55.094 --> 00:16:57.330
which bucket you&#39;re going to
fall into.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.010
Most companies do fall into
one of these buckets.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.100
And so, you should start
thinking about that as

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.048
you&#39;re doing this.

00:17:03.048 --> 00:17:05.876
If, if you want to be in the
elephant category of

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:08.650
$100,000 product, that&#39;s
great.

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:10.360
And you&#39;re going to have a
really high touch sale cycle,

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.230
and that&#39;s fine.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.183
You know, that&#39;s sales force.

00:17:12.183 --> 00:17:14.590
That&#39;s work day, that&#39;s great.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.840
But if you think you&#39;re
going to be a rabbit, and

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.790
sell products for $1,000 a
year to businesses.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:22.580
And your sales process
involves flying out

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.700
to see them three times and
eight demos and, and you know,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.900
three months of redlining.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.180
Then you probably have to
rethink something.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.970
And so I see a lot of startups
most commonly in that,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.330
who want to be the rabbits.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.190
And sell for a low priced
product to businesses,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.910
not thinking about how to do
it in a scalable way.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.590
And that&#39;s one area where you
can get underwater.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.290
Or it just forces you to
increase your prices.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.230
So this is how I think about
different businesses.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.390
And it&#39;ll be helpful for you
when,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.670
once so you can get started,
and

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.240
once you&#39;ve done enough of the
sales to say, okay.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.620
You know, where am I?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.540
And the corollary to that is,
is, how do

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.730
I have to price my product, to
be a viable business?

00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.598
So that is, those are some of
the things that I figured out

00:18:06.598 --> 00:18:09.212
along the way building,
building sales now at a few,

00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:11.280
at a few different companies.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.450
And specifically on this very
narrow stage of,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.100
of zero to 1 million.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.880
After you get to 1 million,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.970
you&#39;ll find there&#39;s a million
blog posts, you know,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.080
about how to get from 5
million to 50 million.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.090
Or 10 million to 100 million.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.270
But this zero to one step, I
wanted to ded,

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.560
focus the presentation on that
today.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.270
Because there&#39;s not as much
written about it and it is

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.619
something that I think is very
opaque to a lot of founders.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.440
I figured this out just by
doing it.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.280
And I&#39;m confident that if
you&#39;re starting a company,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.550
you can too.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.190
If for whatever reason you
would like to do what I

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.120
did and join a startup that&#39;s
figured it out and,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.840
and hone your skills and hone
your craft.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.730
We are hiring at Clever, so
that&#39;s an option.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.120
&gt;&gt; But even if, and if that
doesn&#39;t,

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.850
if you do want to start your
own company, and

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.260
you have questions about
sales,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.390
I put my e-mail address up
here.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.361
And feel free to reach out at
any time, I&#39;m happy to help.

00:18:58.361 --> 00:19:00.537
So, thank you.

00:19:02.978 --> 00:19:04.108
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:06.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That was awesome.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.940
All right.
So now, we&#39;re going to talk

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.360
about a little bit more detail
on how to raise money.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.230
Michael Seibel is first going
to talk about how to

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.073
have a pitch.

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:17.730
And then Dalton and Qasar will
do investor role playing.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:18.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.357
My name is.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.944
Mind blowingly you know, new.

00:19:25.944 --> 00:19:28.045
It really is basic blocking
attack.

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:30.409
And the one point I wanted to
make before we get started is,

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:32.096
we actually don&#39;t spend a lot
of time at YC

00:19:32.096 --> 00:19:33.474
focusing on this.

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:35.245
The main reason is, the best
way you can

00:19:35.245 --> 00:19:38.040
make your pitch better is to
improve your company.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.410
If you&#39;re, if you have
traction and

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.350
your product is doing well,
these conversations are like,

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.150
the investors want to see you
succeed.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.200
And so, if you remember
anything,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.080
it&#39;s make your company better
and the pitch will be easier.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.780
We&#39;re going to spend the time
in the three kind of sections

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.330
before the meeting, which
Michael will kind of focus on.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.970
We&#39;ll do a kind of,

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.070
a role play of what meeting&#39;s
actually look like.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.300
And then we&#39;ll just wrap it
up.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.620
We are going to do Q&amp;A at the
end,

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.070
we&#39;ll kind of save five
minutes.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.220
So if there&#39;s something we
don&#39;t cover,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.880
please write down your
questions and

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.410
we&#39;ll go through them.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:08.490
Now, without further ado.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:08.990
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.408
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:20:13.408 --> 00:20:16.550
&gt;&gt; So, my name is Michael
Seibel.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.470
I&#39;m a current YC partner.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.510
I&#39;ve started two companies.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.530
One was called Justin TV.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:22.700
It ended up selling to Amazon.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.370
The other was called
SocialCam,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.412
which sold to Auto Desk.

00:20:25.412 --> 00:20:29.380
And what I really wanted to do
was break down and

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.230
demystifying the process of
creating a pitch.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.254
Because I think what happens
too often,

00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:36.217
when I see companies come to
talk to me,

00:20:36.217 --> 00:20:39.192
is that they don&#39;t know how to
simply explain what they do,

00:20:39.192 --> 00:20:40.800
and then ask for money.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.070
And that&#39;s basically what you
have to do as a founder.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.830
So we&#39;re going to go over four
things.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.760
The first is what your 30
second pitch is.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.540
This you need to be armed with
constantly.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.870
This is basically, how you
talk about your company.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.700
This is magic.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.690
Whether you&#39;re talking to
people who want to give you

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.050
money or don&#39;t want to give
you money.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.540
You&#39;re talking to your
parents.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.420
This is your go to.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.400
The second is your two minute
pitch.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.822
This is for people who are
more interested.

00:21:03.822 --> 00:21:06.853
This is people who you might
want to raise money from.

00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:08.947
Or people who you might want
to get to work for you, or

00:21:08.947 --> 00:21:09.860
people you actually.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.453
Kind need to get a little bit
deeper.

00:21:12.453 --> 00:21:13.882
Notice that&#39;s where I stop.

00:21:13.882 --> 00:21:16.706
A lot of people practice 10,
30 minute pitches,

00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:19.170
hour pitches, I think that&#39;s
all garbage.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.198
I think you can get everything
you need done in two minutes.

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.792
And one thing I like to tell
founders is the more you talk,

00:21:24.792 --> 00:21:26.414
the more you have the
opportunity to

00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:28.270
say something that people
don&#39;t like.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.560
So just talk less and it&#39;ll
probably be better.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.550
So, then I want to tell you
about when to fund raise,

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.260
because I think a lot of

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.870
companies get this a little
bit wrong.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.630
And then, quickly, how to set
up investor meetings.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.540
So, 30 second pitch, this is
so

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.970
simple, it&#39;s three sentences.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.360
You can take your time, you
can breathe when you do this,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.680
you don&#39;t have to get that
much information out.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.490
The first is one sentence on
what does your company do.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.980
Everyone I meet for the first
time screws this up.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.410
You have to be able to do it
in a way that is simple and

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:07.370
straightforward, that requires
no pre-information on my part.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.140
You have to assume I know
nothing, literally nothing,

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.050
about anything.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.630
This is how you make it super
simple.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.510
So you know, usually what we

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.740
tell people is apply the mom
test.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.220
If in one sentence you cannot
tell your mom what you do,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.220
then rework the sentence.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.790
There is a one sentence
explanation that your mom, or

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.930
your dad is going to
understand.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.150
So really, really start there,
and

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.050
it&#39;s okay if you use really
basic language.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.230
It&#39;s okay if you&#39;re saying hey
we&#39;re Air B and B,

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.580
and we allow you to rent out
the extra room in your house.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.530
That&#39;s simple, right?

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.870
You don&#39;t have to say we&#39;re
Air B and

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.410
B and we&#39;re a marketplace for
space.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.740
I don&#39;t know what that is.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.670
And it&#39;s going to require more
time.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.640
So use simple language.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.590
Very, very important.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.250
The second is how big is your
market?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.760
It makes sense to do a couple
hours of research.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.700
Figure out what general
industry your product is in.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.070
Figure out how big it is.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.790
Investors like to

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.100
hear that you&#39;re in a
multibillion dollar market.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.360
It&#39;s pretty simple to do this.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.072
You know, Air B and

00:23:07.072 --> 00:23:09.740
B might say, how big is the
hotel market?

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.560
How big is the vacation rental
market?

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.800
How big is the online hotel
booking market?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.240
These are simple numbers to
look up on Google.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.960
And it makes an investor
understand, oh wait,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.330
if we&#39;re big, if we really
blow this company up,

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.860
it can be worth billions of
dollars.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.940
Don&#39;t skip this step.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.220
Second sentence, how big is
your market?

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.130
Third sentence, how much
traction do you have?

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.240
Ideally this sentence is
saying something on

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.380
the order of, we launched in
January and

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.570
we&#39;re growing 30% month over
month.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.900
We have this number of sales,
this amount of revenue,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.610
this number of users.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.190
Very simple.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.835
If you can&#39;t speak to traction
in terms of

00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:48.680
pre-launch, you need to
convince the investor that

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.060
you&#39;re moving extremely
quickly.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.530
So, the team started working
in January, by March,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.360
we launched a beta, by April,
we launched our product.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:58.890
Right?

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.850
Convince the investors that
you guys are moving fast.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.730
That this isn&#39;t some long slog
that you guys aren&#39;t thinking

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.140
about this like a big
cooperation.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.230
Your thinking about it

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.060
like a startup where you can
move fast and make mistakes.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.890
That&#39;s all you have to do in
30 seconds.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.188
Three sentences.

00:24:13.188 --> 00:24:14.770
From that basis you should be
able to

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.940
start a conversation about
your company.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.780
From that basis I understand
exactly what you do.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.570
You have no unders, you have
no idea how valuable it is to

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.490
be able to explain to someone
what you do in 30 seconds,

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:26.890
so really internalize that.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.610
Like if you take nothing else
away,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:29.260
that&#39;s going to help you.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.110
Okay.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.780
Two minute pitch.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.960
Now you&#39;ve got someone you
actually have to

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.910
convince of something.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.150
Maybe even someone you have to
ask for money.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.250
So, I like to add four
additional components and

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.370
these also go by very quick.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.340
The first is unique insight.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.230
Now, if you talk to VCs
they&#39;ll say stuff like, what&#39;s

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.860
your secret sauce, what&#39;s your
competitive advantage,

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.300
what&#39;s your unique insight?

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.270
It&#39;s all the same thing.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.640
When I think about unique
insight,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.620
what I think about is here&#39;s
your opportunity to tell me

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.569
something that I don&#39;t know.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:03.760
Here&#39;s your opportunity to
tell me

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.190
something that the biggest
players in the market you&#39;re

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.840
trying to enter don&#39;t
understand or don&#39;t do well.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.510
This is the ah-ha moment.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:15.160
And you&#39;d better have it down
in two sentences.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:15.940
The ah-ha moment.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.680
So you&#39;ve gotta crystallize
all of the reasons why you

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.320
guys are going to kill the
competitors, or the really

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.310
intelligent thought that got
this business started.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.560
In two sentences, and I need
to ah-ha.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.590
You can see whether it&#39;s

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.090
happening when you&#39;re saying
it.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.360
That&#39;s why I like two
sentences, so

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.070
you get in and out fast.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.070
So if I look at you and I&#39;m
like huh.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:37.800
Then it&#39;s okay, you&#39;ve nailed
it.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.360
If I look at you and

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.510
I&#39;m like, I already knew that,
then you didn&#39;t nail it.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.140
If I looked at you and

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.940
I just don&#39;t understand what
you&#39;re talking about,

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.470
you definitely didn&#39;t nail it.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.836
So, practice that unique
insight.

00:25:46.836 --> 00:25:48.910
In your two minute pitch,
that&#39;s all, you&#39;re only

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.780
going to get two sentences to
get that out there, so

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.860
it can&#39;t be complicated, and
that&#39;s basically the theme of

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.000
this whole thing right, it
cannot be complicated.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.190
Next, how do you make money?

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.710
You know, your business model.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.330
I see so many founders run
away from this question

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.310
because they think things
like, if I say advertising,

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.440
people are going to be like,
oh, that&#39;s stupid.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.620
Just say it.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.330
Don&#39;t run away.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.430
If it&#39;s advertising, say
advertising.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.440
Facebook&#39;s a massive
advertising business.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.850
So is Google.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.530
If it&#39;s direct sales, it&#39;s
direct sales.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.493
If it&#39;s you know, a game and

00:26:19.493 --> 00:26:24.070
you&#39;re selling in-app in-app
add ups, like that&#39;s fine.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.210
Just say it.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.520
Don&#39;t run away from this
sentence.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.580
It only has to be one sentence
long.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.820
Where founders get tricked on
how will you make money is,

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.350
they say, well, we&#39;re going to
run advertising, maybe some

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.880
virtual goods, we&#39;re going to
figure out how to do this, and

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.170
maybe this, and maybe this.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.650
Well, now you&#39;re saying
nothing.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.740
Now you&#39;ve told me you have no
idea how you

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.020
want to monetize this.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.900
This was a checkmark that I
just wanted to write, oh,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.220
they know how they&#39;re going to
monetize.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.820
Instead, I&#39;m writing a big
question mark.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.990
So, do the thing that everyone
else in your industry does

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.530
to monetize 95% of the time.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.320
Say it and move on.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.720
Like, it&#39;s totally okay,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.510
no one&#39;s going to hold your
feet to the fire and

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.090
say three years later, you
didn&#39;t monetize this way.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.240
But it&#39;s much better to be
clear and

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.670
concise than it is to start
spouting out every single way

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.490
your company can make money.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.280
The next one is team.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.160
I think that this answer is
actually really clear.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.970
I think you&#39;re trying to do
two things.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.850
If your team has done
something

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:26.088
particularly impressive, you
need to call that out.

00:27:26.088 --> 00:27:28.032
We were the founders of
PayPal,

00:27:28.032 --> 00:27:29.900
probably want to say that.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.454
We were the founders of
Amazon, might,

00:27:31.454 --> 00:27:32.513
probably want to say that.

00:27:32.513 --> 00:27:34.167
So if you guys have done
something that has

00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:36.520
made investors money, you want
to say that.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.126
If not, then please don&#39;t go
on about the awards your team

00:27:40.126 --> 00:27:43.671
has won, or the PhDs or the I
don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t care.

00:27:43.671 --> 00:27:46.640
What we want to hear is how
many founders.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.720
Hopefully between two and
four.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.400
What we want to hear is how
many of them are technical.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.830
How many engineers versus
business people?

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.600
Hopefully it&#39;s 50 50 or more
engineers.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.090
We want to hear is that how
long have you

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.220
guys known each other.

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.330
We don&#39;t want to hear you guys
met at

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:02.607
a founders&#39; dating event three
days ago.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.420
ideally, you&#39;ve known each
other either personally or

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.410
professionally for at least
six months.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.980
We want to hear is that you&#39;re
all working full-time.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.200
It&#39;s really helpful, we&#39;re all
committed to this business.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.920
And what we want to hear is
how you met.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.970
That&#39;s it.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.710
You can get in and out of that
two sentences very easy.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.080
Your only way to build
credentials is if

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.290
you&#39;ve accomplished something.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.270
And with an investor typically
it&#39;s if you&#39;ve

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:33.070
accomplished something that&#39;s
made someone some money.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:35.040
So don&#39;t try to overinflate
yourself if

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.130
you don&#39;t have that stat on
your resume, move on.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.030
The more you talk about a bad
thing, the worse it looks.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.140
So, the last one is the big
ask.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.600
When it comes to this and you
have to figure out

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.510
whether this is a conversation
involves fundraising or not.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.580
What I tell people is like
this is the time where

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.100
you kind of have to know what
you&#39;re talking about.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.060
This is a time where you have
to know,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.540
are you raising on a
convertible note?

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.550
Are you raising on a safe?

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.420
You have to know what the cap
of that safe is.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.200
You have to know how much
money you&#39;re raising.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.960
You have to know what the
minimum check size is.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.710
These are things where if you
don&#39;t know these these things,

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.890
investors going to be like, oh
these guys aren&#39;t serious, or

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.400
they haven&#39;t done their
homework.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.240
So whereas in the rest of

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.340
this whole thing you shouldn&#39;t
use any jargon.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.280
In this part you shouldn&#39;t
just be like, oh,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.930
we&#39;re just raising some money.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:23.990
Like now it&#39;s time to

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.360
actually use a little bit of
that jargon.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.850
If you don&#39;t know that jargon,
Google search it,

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.280
like, it&#39;s real simple.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.120
You guys will learn it fast.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.150
So, that&#39;s it by the way.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.360
That&#39;s too, that&#39;s all your
pitch.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.247
Done, like, game over.

00:29:36.247 --> 00:29:37.686
Now you let them talk.

00:29:37.686 --> 00:29:39.760
So, when to fundraise.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.418
I think this is so important.

00:29:42.418 --> 00:29:44.570
Right, you&#39;ve got this little
Growth graph here.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.810
Investors like to invest based
on traction.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.599
And so literally it&#39;s always
better to raise money when

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:52.757
you&#39;ve got more traction than
less.

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:53.883
Often times though,

00:29:53.883 --> 00:29:57.081
you guys&#39;ll be in a situation
where you&#39;re just starting.

00:29:57.081 --> 00:29:58.567
Or maybe you just launched.

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:02.418
So what you need to do is you
need to think about how do

00:30:02.418 --> 00:30:04.220
you flip the equation?

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.930
Your entire mindset should be,

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.770
typically you are the ones
asking investors for

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.610
money and therefore they are
strong and you&#39;re weak.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.370
How do you create a scenario,

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.380
where you are strong and they
are weak?

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.370
Right?

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.800
That&#39;s where you want to be
fundraising.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.430
So first, how do you know that
you&#39;re strong?

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.990
If investors are asking you to
give you money, you&#39;re strong.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.780
That might be a good time to
start fundraising.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:33.190
If investors aren&#39;t asking
about giving you money,

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.760
are you talking to people
about your startup?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.300
Or are you running super
stealth.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.890
If you&#39;re talking to people
about your startup and

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.350
you&#39;re getting the word out,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.430
either that&#39;s through the
press or

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:42.850
just through talking to your
friends or

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.400
people you know doing
startups,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.490
that&#39;s a good way to kind of
start feeding that.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.700
The second thing is have you
created a plan so

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.970
that you can launch and

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:54.695
grow without needing to raise
a bunch of money.

00:30:54.695 --> 00:30:57.810
95% of the startups that I
meet can get a product to

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.630
market with a very, very
little bit of money.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.210
So never put

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.450
the investor in the ultimate
position of power.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.290
We can&#39;t do anything until you
give us money.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.660
You always want to flip it
around.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.210
You always want it to be, this
things moving,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.200
we all left our jobs, we&#39;re
all working full time.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.500
And it&#39;s moving, if you want
to jump on great, if not.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.410
There are a lot of angel
investors.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.860
That&#39;s the attitude you
want to have.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.870
That&#39;s the confidence you
want to have.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:25.280
If you need money early,
always plan for

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.540
needing less money.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.400
And always be able to show
that

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.650
you&#39;ve got a fully committed
team that&#39;s working fast.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:33.723
That&#39;s going to be

00:31:33.723 --> 00:31:36.313
how you gain an advantage when
you can&#39;t show traction.

00:31:36.313 --> 00:31:39.048
If you can show that investor
that you haven&#39;t launched yet,

00:31:39.048 --> 00:31:41.414
but you&#39;ve done eight months
of work in one month, or

00:31:41.414 --> 00:31:42.003
two months.

00:31:42.003 --> 00:31:44.739
That you&#39;ve got a great team
that have all quit their jobs

00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:46.399
and they&#39;re totally committed.

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:48.553
You get some of that advantage
back.

00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:49.514
But you don&#39;t get all of

00:31:49.514 --> 00:31:51.750
the advantage unless you&#39;re
launched and growing.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.630
So something to keep in mind.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.020
Finally, how to set up
investor meetings.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.830
This is really, really simple,
but I&#39;m surprised at

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.160
how many companies don&#39;t get
this right.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.080
The first is you want a warm
introduction from another

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.920
entrepreneur, preferably, or a
previous investor of yours.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.420
That&#39;s where you want to
start.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.740
If someone who has passed on
your company as

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.910
an investor offers you, to
make introductions,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:19.770
that&#39;s kryptonite.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:20.290
Don&#39;t touch that.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.850
So first, warm introduction.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.490
Very simple, you don&#39;t want to
cold call these people,

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.880
you don&#39;t want to bum rush
these people, the person,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.760
the credibility of the person
who&#39;s introducing you to

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.420
an investor is a big part on

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.700
whether the investor will take
that meeting.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.660
Second, think in parallel.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.290
So many people that I meet
will run the fundraising this

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.650
super slow process, we met
with one guy this week,

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:43.710
we&#39;re going to schedule a
meeting with

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.030
another guy next week, another
guy three weeks from now.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.500
When you&#39;re fundraising you&#39;re
on.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.700
It&#39;s a sprint, it&#39;s not a
marathon.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.179
So you want to schedule all of

00:32:52.179 --> 00:32:54.890
your meetings during the same
week.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.830
It&#39;s extremely hard to do, but
here&#39;s one trick that I love.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.330
Tell when you&#39;re emailing
investors,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.340
you&#39;re getting those warm
intros,

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.450
the investors email you back.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.240
You say, hey, we&#39;d love to set
up a meeting but

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.060
we&#39;re building like crazy for
the next two weeks.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.600
So can we set it up in that
third week?

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.640
Right?

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.060
So then, you&#39;ve, I&#39;ve e-mailed
every one that, right?

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.510
So every one schedules that
meeting three weeks out.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.660
It&#39;s better for them because
their calendar&#39;s open.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.090
It&#39;s better for you because
you&#39;ve got all

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:19.750
your meetings in one week.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.000
And also, what did you do?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.560
You hinted, hey, I&#39;m not
desperate for the money.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.900
We&#39;re building.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.350
Like, I could meet you in
three weeks.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.190
But we&#39;re building.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.160
We&#39;re busy.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.540
Like, it&#39;s signalling all of
the right things.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.930
So that&#39;s the best way to
kind of go about how

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:34.630
you&#39;re going to do that.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.210
The last thing is one team
member should be invested in

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.180
fundraising full time.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.330
It shouldn&#39;t be something that
takes over the whole company,

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.520
because it&#39;s very, very
distracting.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.130
So with that, let&#39;s kick it
off to the next part of this.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.100
Who am I handing it to?

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.136
Big Dalton.

00:33:51.136 --> 00:33:52.940
Yeah, that might.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.315
Oh, beautiful.
All right.

00:33:54.315 --> 00:33:59.920
Hi my name is Dalton Caldwell
I&#39;m one of the.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.100
Camera can get us here, okay.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.110
Yeah, I&#39;m one of the partners
at YC and one of the things

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.980
that we&#39;re going to do today
real quick is a mock pitch.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.040
And first of all I know this
is a bit contrived but

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.580
this is in this format of like
a college class,

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.640
we&#39;re going to do our best to,
to have fun and

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.790
kind of demonstrate what it&#39;s
like.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.820
And I realize there&#39;s a
million reasons why this,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.770
why you could say, oh this
isn&#39;t realistic of what pitch

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.400
is really like but you know,
again, there&#39;s, there&#39;s a lot.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.500
Yeah.
That we can show you.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.060
Just in terms of my background
over my career,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.950
I&#39;ve raised 85 million over
several companies, so

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:34.670
I&#39;ve sat in a lot of investor
meetings.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.400
And so, I&#39;m going to be

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.580
pulling as many things as I
can.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.480
So again, we&#39;re just going to
try to show you

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.810
something to talk to, and use
it as a learning session.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.980
And you already did your intro
earlier Caspar, right?

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.540
It&#39;s yeah I&#39;ve, I mean, I&#39;ve
done a couple startups.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.129
Cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.946
So we&#39;re going to do two
pitches, and

00:34:49.946 --> 00:34:50.936
we&#39;re going to go through them
pretty fast.

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:53.843
And as, as Michael said, these
tend to go fast.

00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:55.259
So let&#39;s go dive into the
first one.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.440
Okay, so so Caspar, I
understand you, you&#39;re coming

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.440
to pitch me to, can, what can
you tell me about what you do?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.840
So we&#39;re building a
communication platform that

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:12.550
will allow you know,
businesses and consumers

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.800
to collaborate on one single
platform rather than

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.770
the kind of fractured state
that they&#39;re in right now.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:20.810
and.
I don&#39;t know,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:21.580
I, I don&#39;t follow.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:26.090
So, like think about like what
like WhatsApp or

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.320
Snapchat that&#39;s for consumers.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.670
We want to do that for
businesses.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.270
and, and so, what the.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.670
I have to do this with a
straight face.

00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:40.580
What, what that what that
means is we want to

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.280
enable consumers to talk to
businesses.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:45.430
And that&#39;s really, what really
the goal of our business,

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.490
of our startup business.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.850
I still don&#39;t, so, who uses
this,

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:49.780
what does this product do?

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.410
so, I mean, it, it.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.250
It&#39;s for consumers and

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.450
businesses, a messaging
product.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:56.840
a, it allows consumers to
send.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.660
Why, why would,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.753
why would a consumer want to
use your product?

00:35:59.753 --> 00:36:03.960
Because they want to message a
business.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.260
okay.
well, okay,

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.335
what can you tell me about
the,

00:36:06.335 --> 00:36:08.670
the market or what the opport,
what&#39;s the size of this.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.570
How is this coming together?

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.300
Well, I mean.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.370
Messaging companies are very
big.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.180
Obviously Whats App sold for
like $19 billion and Snap Chat

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.700
is like really growing very
quickly as well so we,

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:25.310
I mean we think the
opportunity is very big.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:30.593
Okay ,.
So, okay.

00:36:30.593 --> 00:36:34.250
Okay, could you tell me a
little about your traction,

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.790
your numbers.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.740
Like, have you, have you given
this to people yet.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.740
yeah, I mean we don&#39;t want to
kind of open the Komodo and

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.512
kind of go into all the
details here.

00:36:41.512 --> 00:36:42.980
I, kind of at a high level.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.010
We&#39;re live.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:47.390
We definitely have thousands
of users in the Bay area.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.700
Hundred of business, you know,
have kind of.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.610
Can you tell me who some of
those businesses are?

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.650
There&#39;s ones that you&#39;ve been
to.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.190
We don&#39;t, we don&#39;t really
want to get too much into

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.990
the details, because, you
know, we&#39;re still early and

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.300
we don&#39;t want, you know, we&#39;re
trying to stay stealth.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.170
Okay, well, can you tell me
about what you&#39;ve learned so

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.250
far, what insights you&#39;ve had
from.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.100
Yes.
The consumers are sending

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.480
messages to these businesses,
and we think that&#39;s great.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.410
so, and these businesses are
responding to the messages,

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:13.850
and we think that&#39;s, you know,

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.410
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s obvious
that that would happen.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.510
So, can you tell me about what
your business model is,

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.000
and how.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.855
Yeah, so we,

00:37:21.855 --> 00:37:26.060
we charge businesses like a
monthly rate.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.250
We haven&#39;t precisely figured
out what that is we&#39;ve,

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.100
we&#39;ve, right now we&#39;re free
for

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.170
the few hundred companies
we&#39;re in right now.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.740
But we&#39;re looking to probably
do a monthly something.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.252
How much do you

00:37:38.252 --> 00:37:40.614
think a business will be
willing to pay?

00:37:40.614 --> 00:37:43.180
We think certainly 10 to
$15,000 a month.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.220
Okay so, so anyway could you
tell me a little bit

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.590
about your team and who you
have working on this.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.350
yeah, there&#39;s we have five
founders technically I&#39;m

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:57.210
the only one who&#39;s full time
right now the,

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.950
we&#39;re raising money so we can
get, you know,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.430
the rest of the team on board
yeah.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.590
That&#39;s this.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.910
Or can any of the founders
program, or, or.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:08.910
yeah, yeah.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:13.100
I mean we have, I mean one of
them is a bio PhD but

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.248
he&#39;s like he&#39;s really picked
up coding.

00:38:15.248 --> 00:38:16.071
the, the.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.980
I mean, I&#39;m a Python
developer,

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.620
I did learn Python the hard
way.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.440
Oh, look at the time.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.820
Well, it&#39;s been really great
meeting you.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:28.812
Please keep me in the loop,
this sounds fantastic.

00:38:28.812 --> 00:38:30.000
[CROSS-TALK].

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.833
I&#39;ll send you an update.

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:34.220
Great.
That was awful.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.400
So let&#39;s just go through, so.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.760
That was obviously not strong.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.090
So let&#39;s just talk about some
of the mistakes.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.730
So first of all, you need to

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.980
make sure the person you&#39;re
talking to knows what you do.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.600
This just seems really simple,
but it&#39;s not.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.930
Yeah, this seems simple, but
it&#39;s not.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.370
So many times, people get
flustered.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.400
They get nervous, and they
start talking really fast.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.040
And there&#39;s no way you&#39;re ever
going to convince anyone of

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.410
anything if they don&#39;t know,

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:58.520
even what your app actually
is.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.130
You have to know your numbers
obviously.

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.100
If you&#39;re very vague or

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.940
evasive, like don&#39;t even have
the meeting.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.740
If you don&#39;t feel comfortable
telling an investor what your

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.580
numbers are, don&#39;t even meet
with them.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.526
It means you&#39;re not ready yet,
right?

00:39:08.526 --> 00:39:11.086
For market size, try to give
some plausible bottom-up

00:39:11.086 --> 00:39:13.646
analysis and don&#39;t just
name-drop big companies that

00:39:13.646 --> 00:39:16.820
aren&#39;t even really related to
what you&#39;re doing.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.440
People tend to do that a lot.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.160
Try to have insights, try to
convince me that there&#39;s

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.940
something that I don&#39;t already
know about the market that I

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.600
learn talking to you, rather
than just

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.110
what everyone knows about what
the market is.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:30.370
Right, I learned nothing
during that particular pitch.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.470
also, the team&#39;s just like,
why are you working on this,

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.850
why are you suited for it is a
good thing to do.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.720
And finally, like,

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:37.090
he didn&#39;t drive the
conversation anywhere.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.600
Like, obviously that went
poorly, and

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.170
he just let the conversation
just, like,

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.900
flail around until I cut the
medium because we ran out of

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.610
time as fast as I could.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.970
So anyway, that was, that was
not a good pitch.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.670
So let&#39;s, let&#39;s try that
again.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.230
Okay, all right.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:52.120
Let&#39;s do this.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.660
Okay.
All right Caspar,

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.720
well so I understand you have
a company and can you,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.010
can you just tell me a little
about what you guys do.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.660
Yes.
So we&#39;re a messaging product.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.460
We allow, I mean that sounds
kind of vague, so

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.640
what we allow you to do you to
do is essentially message

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.180
a location.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.840
So when you walk into a Crate
and Barrel,

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.600
you can send the Crate and
Barrel manager a message like

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.310
hey there&#39;s puke in the
hallway.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.750
Or if you&#39;re in the airport,
I&#39;m trying to find this

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.560
specific gate because I&#39;m not
at this airport,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.690
where is you know where&#39;s a
terminal for Virgin.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.060
Or if you&#39;re at Target, what
aisle.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.070
Okay, so is this a mobile app
or what how do I use it?

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.690
Yeah, so on the consumer side
we have iOS Android app,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.320
but really getting consumers
to

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.880
download apps is obviously
very difficult.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.500
Yeah.
I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.190
In.
I don&#39;t usually

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.010
just download apps.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:30.952
Yeah.
To send a message.

00:40:30.952 --> 00:40:31.492
[CROSS-TALK].

00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:33.860
In, in most businesses we have
a called action,

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.461
which says text the owner
directly.

00:40:35.461 --> 00:40:36.000
Oh.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.110
We&#39;ve tested actually a bunch
of

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.330
copy that works the best in
small print.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.950
We have, the messages are
anonymous,

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.580
they also lowers the barrier
to entry.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.250
I think the most
counterintuitive thing we&#39;ve

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.910
learned in the kind of launch
that we&#39;ve had where,

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:48.730
in 350 locations in the Bay,
we&#39;ve been doing this for

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:51.290
about three months we&#39;re about
11%

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.710
weekly growth rate in terms of
acquiring businesses.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.420
But the most counter-intuitive
thing that we learned,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.450
because we weren&#39;t actually
sure,

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.480
is, will people send messages
when they walk

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.660
into [CROSS-TALK] and they do.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.800
What&#39;s the number one type of
message that people send?

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.806
So you would, so originally,

00:41:03.806 --> 00:41:05.586
we started this product off
thinking this is going to be,

00:41:05.586 --> 00:41:06.960
like, in-location feedback.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.060
That was the premise,
in-location feedback.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.205
What we found is more than
half the messages,

00:41:11.205 --> 00:41:12.510
are actually not about
feedback at all,

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.822
they ask things like we,

00:41:13.822 --> 00:41:16.750
we were in this location in
San Jose this Kabob stand,

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.300
father and son, it&#39;s just a
take out place, and

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.270
we saw messages that go
through,

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.580
that went through that said
like are you hiring?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.110
And that&#39;s like very strange
because you

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.690
would think like why wouldn&#39;t
you just ask the owner.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:26.940
Yeah.
But we realized that we know

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:27.930
this is the owner, and

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.490
the person who&#39;s walking in
doesn&#39;t and so

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.970
they, they do prefer to
actually just text the owner

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.310
because they think that&#39;s a,
that&#39;s an easier medium.

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.559
Okay, so it&#39;s like a
suggestion box, or

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.355
it&#39;s like a way to just like
message a business.

00:41:37.355 --> 00:41:39.549
Yeah, initially that&#39;s what we
thought it was, but

00:41:39.549 --> 00:41:41.695
what we actually discovered
was the vast majority,

00:41:41.695 --> 00:41:43.450
I shouldn&#39;t say vast majority,
over half

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.937
the messages are actually just
things like when do you open,

00:41:45.937 --> 00:41:48.100
when do you close because
that&#39;s not on Google.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.800
Do you, do, you know, are you
catering can you,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.370
do you have any reservations
available tonight, et cetera.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.260
Okay, okay.
Well, look,

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.080
in terms of your traction it

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.500
sounds like you said you had
some businesses, like.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.310
Yeah.
Tell me about what,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.410
what you guys have right now.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.350
So we have about 350
businesses,

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:01.930
all from San Jose to San
Francisco.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:03.760
We sold them ourselves as
three founders.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.030
We&#39;re all technical, but we
actually did all the sales

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.240
because we learned a lot about
how these businesses work.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.740
We actually come from a retail
background.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.212
We originally built this
product for

00:42:11.212 --> 00:42:13.452
large enterprise players like
Starbucks and Walmart.

00:42:13.452 --> 00:42:15.608
But we recognize that closing
those contracts, and

00:42:15.608 --> 00:42:18.111
our limited amount of runway
wouldn&#39;t really be possible.

00:42:18.111 --> 00:42:19.876
So we wanted to get the
product in the hands of users.

00:42:19.876 --> 00:42:20.991
So we did SMBs.

00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:22.340
And that&#39;s when we discovered
hey,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.741
this like, this messaging
product.

00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:25.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, that sounds
interesting.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.540
It sounds like you have some
customers.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.120
&gt;&gt; Yes, so we get.
&gt;&gt; How, how

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.000
could this be big though?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Like, okay, maybe you can
100,000 customers.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, in terms of like,
numbers, we, we see one and

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.770
half messages on average per
location per day.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.170
That might not sound a lot,
but

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.620
for a business, that&#39;s
skidding 30 messages.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.800
You take like a Yelp review or
a Google review.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.720
In a lifetime of visits, they
might get five or seven.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.050
So they&#39;re getting a, a huge
volume of messages relative to

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:49.340
what they tend to experience
and they&#39;re private, so

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.280
they&#39;re not public.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.850
So in terms of, how do we
actually make money, it&#39;s not,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.140
you know, frankly speaking,

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.990
we don&#39;t have a very clear
answer there.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.970
The two paths are the SMB side
or

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.950
the LCS side, the large
customer side.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.940
Large customers, we know from
our retail experience,

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.900
just regular feedback tools
are 3 to 4 million per year,

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.016
so a like a Sear&#39;s, where we
came from.

00:43:09.016 --> 00:43:12.810
SMBs we&#39;ve tested with are
willing to pay $50 a month,

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.900
so, I, I, you know, I
certainly I think this is.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:16.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; This can be a large

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.050
business, but, and there&#39;s
clear ways to make money, but.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:20.570
I could see, I could see that.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:21.540
Just a couple things like,

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.610
can you tell me about your
distribution strategy and

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.830
also just a little bit about
the team.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:25.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.770
distribution so the thing that
we learned in

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.490
selling to these SMBs is it&#39;s
really freaking hard.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.710
there, the formula LTV minus
CPA, lifetime value minus cost

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.740
price acquisition in SMB is
never going to work out.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.270
Right.
&gt;&gt; And so we

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.150
have two solutions.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.250
One is to go up market,

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.490
like we originally planned,
the Starbucks or

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:44.250
Walmarts or two is actually
essentially pair with

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.380
consumer facing companies
Yelp, Google, Facebook.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.200
&gt;&gt; Have you been talking to
them,

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:47.960
do they actually want to do
it?

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we&#39;ve talked to
Google and

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.600
Facebook we&#39;re meeting with
Yelp.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.990
What we&#39;re basically want to
do is every time you

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.480
search for a business there
should be a message button.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.600
We want to get consumers in
the habit of knowing,

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.610
they can send, essentially a
text message to any business.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.800
That can help us get broad
distribution.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.442
Our real vision is to become
kind of that infrastructure,

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:07.500
that messaging infrastructure
between consumers and

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.030
business.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.880
If that doesn&#39;t work, let&#39;s
say Google, Facebook, and

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.440
Yelp don&#39;t want to give up
that valuable property.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.820
It&#39;s really an ad unit.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:13.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.110
&gt;&gt; we, we do want to sell this
as a feedback tool to large,

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:17.710
large players.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:18.353
&gt;&gt; All right.
Can you tell me

00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:19.070
a little about the team?

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:20.080
We&#39;re running low on, on time.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there&#39;s three of us.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.970
All technical.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.740
We Mike and I did a company
before.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.400
Sunny is an ex-Google
engineer.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.910
We come from retail.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.490
So and our first startup was a
failure.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:31.880
So, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s
good or

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.440
bad but, we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve worked
together and, yeah.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.190
We&#39;re all technical, we built
everything ourselves.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.380
And we sold everything
ourselves.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So we&#39;ve already had

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:41.360
a couple conversations with
your firm.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.769
We&#39;re raising 500,000 and 8.5
million convertible note.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.820
Of that 500, 250&#39;s committed
by Mike Mapels,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.800
Eli Gill, and Aiden Sinkit.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.850
And Mike with Floodgate is
willing to fill the round.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:57.790
We think your, you know,

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.680
you particularly, you and your
firm can bring a lot to

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.090
the team with your retail
experience.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.150
Is this something that&#39;s
interesting to you?

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:06.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I, I think
this is really interesting.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.590
I mean, I would need to talk
to a couple more folks on my

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:11.420
side, but I do think this
this,

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.520
this could be pretty big.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.160
&gt;&gt; Yes, since we&#39;ve had a
couple conversations before

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.380
and and we&#39;re certainly
willing to meet again,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.880
we are closing a round this
Friday.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.740
And so, certainly take time
and let, you know, and

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.730
let, your other partners know.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.200
I&#39;ll be available between now
and Friday.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.420
I&#39;ll give you another call
before Friday.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.000
Before we close the round.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.880
But we&#39;d love to actually see
you, see you in the round.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Well sounds good.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.360
I gotta go, but thanks for
talking to me.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.630
&gt;&gt; Great.
Thanks.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.560
Okay.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.230
All right,.
&gt;&gt; So

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:39.780
very different class type of,
type of a conversation.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:40.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so do you have a
clicker.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So in terms of that one,

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.720
you know, some key points here
is, try to

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.190
actually tell a narrative that
makes sense to people.

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:50.230
You notice there was
narratives there.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.070
He was talking about people,
how they really use it.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.880
Were able to tie it down to
the real world, which is good.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.700
He was able to demonstrate
insights, and

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.300
actually tell me something I
didn&#39;t already know about

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.850
the market, like, there were,
there were some tidbits there.

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:04.590
It was more, it was more of a
collaborative meeting where it

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.440
felt more like a conversation
than just like a,

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.350
like I was interviewing him
about something in,

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:09.990
in my opinion.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:12.030
He actually asked for money.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.360
And this is the other key
thing is at the end,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.450
you saw I could have easily
just been like,

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.550
okay, gotta go.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:20.020
But he, he did talk about
fundraising as,

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:20.930
as Michael mentioned.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.030
And he was able to provide all
the context and

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.250
all the questions I would need

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.200
to actually have a serious
conversation with him.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.550
If he was cagey about it or
shy about it,

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.090
and not clear on the numbers,
that there&#39;s a very high,

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.010
good chance that, you know, I
probably would have just ended

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.450
the conversation, due to time
pressure.

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:38.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s interesting.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.600
And we, we sit on this side a
lot.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.580
You really, you can tell when
people are very passionate and

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.060
know their business very, very
well.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.980
And that&#39;s what you have to
become.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.200
okay.
So closing thoughts here

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.710
before we, what you want to do
after the meeting.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.910
Before we get into the Q&amp;A.

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:52.590
We&#39;re running a little short
on time.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.540
After the meeting, the first
thing,

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.000
just like Tyler said in the
sales thing, follow up.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.540
This is, this is important.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.190
And anything other than a
check, or wired funds is a no.

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.260
So if they say, we gotta keep
talking to partners,

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.970
I assume that&#39;s a no.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.804
And so, you do want to put
some pressure.

00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:10.540
The way that you can do that
is get deal heat.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.310
Deal heat is just a term which
means there&#39;s a demand for

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.560
your, to, to be in your round.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.550
This is the easiest way and

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.600
an important way to actually
drive up price, et cetera.

00:47:19.655 --> 00:47:21.440
Due diligence on the
investors.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.820
So let&#39;s say you have that
500,000 raise for your

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.908
seed round on the 8.5 million
like we used in this example.

00:47:26.908 --> 00:47:28.370
Due diligence investors.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.740
If you do find it, I, I do,
due diligence on adults, and

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.990
I find, hey, he&#39;s actually not
a great investor.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:35.030
I can get Elaud, or Mike
Maples, or

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.810
whoever to actually fill the
rest of the round.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.640
It&#39;s surprising to us,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.700
how many entrepreneurs don&#39;t
do this.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.520
You would, it&#39;s like,

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.080
you would actually spend a lot
of time hiring somebody.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.500
You&#39;re selling a part of your
company to somebody,

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.470
you should know who you&#39;re
selling it to.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.240
To make sure they,

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.980
you know, they&#39;re the type of
people you think they are.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:53.810
And then last, know when to
stop.

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:55.910
So some founders get so good
at fundraising they just

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:58.160
want to do it all the time
because it&#39;s much easier to

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.540
do than actually building the
company.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you think you can

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.954
fundraising does not equal
success and just because.

00:48:03.954 --> 00:48:04.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You fund-raise does not

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.300
mean you succeeded and nobody
realizes that and

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.970
I&#39;m, we say this and we&#39;ll say
this now, but

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.320
I&#39;m sure everyone will still
equate fundraising with

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.250
success and read about
someone&#39;s fundraising and

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:15.730
assume that means they&#39;re
successful.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:16.900
&gt;&gt; Well my, my, my intuition
as to why this is

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.910
the case is because a lot of
smart people their whole life,

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.490
they&#39;ve like, applied to good
schools and applied to

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.530
good jobs, and they, they just
think fundraising is

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.050
another like application they
can just kind of check off.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:28.610
And building a company is much
more ambiguous, but.

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.550
Anyways, that&#39;s, that&#39;s the
session.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.490
I don&#39;t if we have time for,
oh.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.110
The edge is under,

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.740
underlining, building your
company.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.620
Fundraising is not the goal.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.980
&gt;&gt; Can you guys just stick
around for

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.670
a few minutes after, and
answer questions?

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:39.440
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can do that.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.330
&gt;&gt; All right.
Thank you very much,

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.433
that was great.
